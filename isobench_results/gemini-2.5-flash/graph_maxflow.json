Initialize the total maximum flow (`max_flow`) to 0.\n2.  Create a residual capacity matrix (`residual_capacity`) which is initially identical to the given `capacity` matrix. This matrix stores the remaining capacity of edges. For every edge (u,v) with capacity C(u,v), we also implicitly consider a reverse edge (v,u) with initial residual capacity 0.\n3.

Initialize the flow for all edges to 0.\n2.  Maintain a residual graph, which initially is the same as the original graph's capacities.\n3.  Repeatedly find an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the residual graph using BFS.\n4.

The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of edges (u, v) where u ∈ S and v ∈ T.\n\nIn our final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source (0) is $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThe set of nodes not reachable from the source is $T = \\{4\\}$.\n\nLet's sum the capacities of edges in the *original* network that go from a node in S to a node in T:\n- Edge (0, 4): Capacity = 4\n- Edge (1, 4): Capacity = 5\n- Edge (2, 4): Capacity = 9\n- Edge (3, 4): Capacity = 1\n\nTotal cut capacity = $4 + 5 + 9 + 1 = 19$.\n\nSince the max flow found (19) equals the min cut capacity (19), our result is consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{19}$.",

Using BFS ensures that the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) is found in the residual graph, which guarantees termination for integer capacities and provides a polynomial time complexity.\n\n**Network Representation:**\n- Source node: `s = 0`\n- Sink node: `t = 3`\n- Capacity Matrix `C`:\n  ```\n  Nodes: 0  1  2  3\n       0 [0, 0, 7, 3]\n       1 [0, 0, 0, 5]\n       2 [0, 4, 0, 3]\n       3 [0, 0, 0, 0]\n  ```\n  (e.g., `C[0][2] = 7` means capacity from node 0 to node 2 is 7)\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.

The network is represented by a capacity matrix where `capacity_matrix[i][j]` denotes the maximum capacity of the edge from node `i` to node `j`. A value of 0 means no direct edge.\n\nThis is a classic maximum flow problem, which can be solved using the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm**. A common implementation of Ford-Fulkerson that guarantees polynomial time complexity is the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, which uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths in the residual graph.\n\n**Algorithm Steps (Edmonds-Karp):**\n1.  Initialize the total flow `max_flow_value` to 0.\n2.  Create a **residual graph** `R`, which is initially a copy of the capacity matrix. `R[u][v]` represents the remaining capacity of the edge `(u, v)`.\n3.  While an augmenting path (a path from source to sink with positive residual capacity) exists in the residual graph:\n    a.  Use BFS to find a path from the source node to the sink node in the residual graph. During BFS, keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path.\n    b.  If no path is found, terminate the algorithm.\n    c.  If a path is found, determine the **bottleneck capacity** (the minimum residual capacity) along this path. This is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through this path.\n    d.  Add the bottleneck capacity to `max_flow_value`.\n    e.  For each edge `(u, v)` in the found path:\n        i. Decrease the residual capacity `R[u][v]` by the bottleneck capacity.\n        ii.

But from source 0, no path to 4 can be found.\n\n*   **No augmenting path found.**\n\n**Final Maximum Flow:** The algorithm terminates.\n\n**Total Flow Calculation:**\nThe total flow can be seen as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source node:\n*   Flow (0,1) = 1\n*   Flow (0,2) = 7\n*   Flow (0,3) = 1\n*   Flow (0,4) = 2\nTotal flow = 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 11.\n\nAlternatively, sum of flows entering the sink node:\n*   Flow (0,4) = 2\n*   Flow (1,4) = 1\n*   Flow (2,4) = 7\n*   Flow (3,4) = 1\nTotal flow = 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 11.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe maximum flow from source node 0 to sink node 4 is **11**.",

This strategy helps ensure the algorithm's polynomial time complexity and prevents it from getting stuck in long, redundant paths.\n4.  **Bottleneck Capacity:** For each augmenting path found, the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed is limited by the minimum capacity of any edge along that path (the \"bottleneck\").\n5.  **Flow Augmentation:** Once the bottleneck capacity is determined, that amount of flow is added to the total `max_flow`. The actual flow on the edges in the network is updated: increased for forward edges and decreased for backward edges (which effectively increases their reverse capacity in the residual graph).\n6.  **Termination:** The process repeats until BFS can no longer find any path from the source to the sink, indicating that the maximum flow has been achieved (by the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, at this point, the minimum cut will be saturated).\n\nFollowing these steps, as demonstrated in the manual trace and the provided code, leads to a maximum flow of 9 for the given network.\n\nThe maximum flow from source 0 to sink 3 is: 9",

While an augmenting path (a path from source to sink with positive residual capacity) can be found in `R` using BFS:\n    a.

The sum of flows pushed along all found paths is the maximum flow.\n1.  Initially, flow 3 is sent directly from 0 to 3.\n2.  Then, flow 2 is sent along the path 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3.\n3.  No further paths can be found with positive residual capacity, indicating that the max flow has been reached. The total flow is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nThis result aligns with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, where a cut separating {0,2} from {1,3} has a capacity of $C(0,3) + C(2,1) = 3 + 2 = 5$.",

By updating the residual capacities (decreasing for forward edges, increasing for backward edges), it correctly models the available capacity. When no more paths can be found, the total accumulated flow represents the maximum possible flow in the network. In this case, the sum of capacities of edges originating from the source (0->1, 0->3, 0->4) is 4+3+9=16, and all these edges were saturated, forming an s-t cut whose capacity equals the max flow, consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.",

By updating residual capacities, it correctly accounts for both forward flow and the possibility of canceling previously sent flow (via backward edges). When no more paths can be found, it means the network is saturated, and the total accumulated flow is the maximum possible. This result is guaranteed by the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, which states that the maximum flow is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut separating the source from the sink. In our final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source is just `{0}`, while the remaining nodes `{1, 2, 3}` form the other partition of the cut. The sum of capacities of edges from `{0}` to `{1, 2, 3}` is `C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17`, which matches the maximum flow.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{17}$.",

The flow through a series of pipes is limited by the narrowest pipe.\n*   The capacity from node 0 to node 1 is 6.\n*   The capacity from node 1 to node 2 is 4.\nThe maximum amount of \"stuff\" that can flow through this series of connections is limited by the edge with the smallest capacity, which is the edge (1, 2) with a capacity of 4.\n\nThis aligns with the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem, where the maximum flow is equal to the minimum capacity of an S-T cut. In this case, the cut separating {0, 1} from {2} (which only cuts edge (1,2)) has a capacity of 4, and this is the minimum cut.",

The `max_flow` variable holds the maximum flow that can be sent from the source to the sink.\n\n**Final Maximum Flow:** `7`\n\n**Verification (Min-Cut):**\nAccording to the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, the maximum flow is equal to the minimum cut. A min-cut divides the graph into two sets of nodes (S, T) where the source is in S and the sink is in T. The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T. In the final residual graph, S is the set of nodes reachable from the source, and T is the rest.\n\n*   In the final `residual_capacity` matrix, perform BFS from source 0:\n    *   From 0, no edges have positive residual capacity (all `residual_capacity[0][v]` are 0).\n    *   Therefore, the only node reachable from 0 is 0 itself.\n*   So, `S = {0}`\n*   And `T = {1, 2}`\n\nNow, sum the capacities of original edges going from a node in S to a node in T:\n*   Edge (0, 1): Capacity = 2 (0 is in S, 1 is in T)\n*   Edge (0, 2): Capacity = 5 (0 is in S, 2 is in T)\n*   Total cut capacity = `C(0,1) + C(0,2) = 2 + 5 = 7`.\n\nThe maximum flow (7) equals the minimum cut capacity (7), which confirms our result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$",

A cut (S, T) partitions the nodes into two sets, S (containing the source) and T (containing the sink). The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T.\n\nAfter the algorithm terminates, the set of nodes reachable from the source (0) in the residual graph `R` forms the set `S` of the min-cut, and the unreachable nodes form `T`.\n\nLet's perform a BFS from the source (0) in the final residual graph `R` to find reachable nodes:\n*   Start BFS from 0. Queue: `[0]`. Visited: `{0}`.\n*   Dequeue 0. Neighbors with `R[0][v] > 0`: None (all `R[0][v]` are 0).\n*   Queue is empty.\n\nSo, the set of reachable nodes `S = {0}`.\nThe set of unreachable nodes (including the sink) `T = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nNow, let's sum the capacities of edges in the original graph that go from a node in `S` to a node in `T`:\n*   `C[0][1] = 3`\n*   `C[0][2] = 6`\n*   `C[0][3] = 5`\n*   `C[0][4] = 3`\n\nTotal cut capacity = `3 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 17`.\nThis matches the calculated `max_flow`, confirming the correctness of the result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{17}$.",

The max flow equals the min cut capacity.\n\nFrom the final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source `0` are `S = {0, 1, 2}`.\n(To check: Start BFS from 0 in the final residual graph. From 0, can reach 1 (cap 3) and 2 (cap 4). From 1, can reach 0 (cap 4). From 2, can reach 0 (cap 4) and 1 (cap 9). No other nodes are reachable.)\n\nThe set of unreachable nodes `T = {3, 4}`. Note that the sink `4` is in `T`, confirming that `S` is indeed the source side of a cut.\n\nCalculate the capacity of this cut (sum of original capacities of edges from `S` to `T`):\nEdges from `S = {0, 1, 2}` to `T = {3, 4}`:\n*   `C[0][3] = 4`\n*   `C[0][4] = 9`\n*   `C[1][4] = 4`\n*   `C[2][4] = 4`\n\nTotal cut capacity = `4 + 9 + 4 + 4 = 21`.\n\nThis matches the maximum flow calculated, confirming the result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{21}$.",

This process continues until no more paths can be found.\n\n**Step 1: Initial State**\n*   Current total flow = 0.\n*   All edge flows are 0.\n\n**Step 2: Find an Augmenting Path**\n*   We can see a path: `0 -> 1 -> 2`.\n*   Let's determine the bottleneck capacity along this path:\n    *   Capacity of edge (0, 1) = 5\n    *   Capacity of edge (1, 2) = 1\n*   The minimum capacity on this path is 1 (due to edge 1 -> 2). This is our `path_flow`.\n\n**Step 3: Augment Flow**\n*   Increase the flow along the path by `path_flow = 1`.\n    *   Flow on (0, 1) increases by 1 (current flow becomes 1).\n    *   Flow on (1, 2) increases by 1 (current flow becomes 1).\n*   Add `path_flow` to the total flow.\n    *   Total flow = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n**Step 4: Check for More Augmenting Paths**\n*   Now, let's look at the residual capacities:\n    *   Edge (0, 1): Original capacity 5, current flow 1. Residual capacity = 5 - 1 = 4.\n    *   Edge (1, 2): Original capacity 1, current flow 1. Residual capacity = 1 - 1 = 0.\n*   Is there any path from source (0) to sink (2) using only edges with positive residual capacity?\n    *   From 0, we can go to 1 (residual capacity 4).\n    *   From 1, we cannot go to 2 because the residual capacity of (1, 2) is now 0.\n*   No other paths exist. Therefore, no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe algorithm terminates. The maximum flow found is 1.\n\n**Verification using Min-Cut Max-Flow Theorem:**\nThe Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem states that the maximum flow in a network is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut. A cut is a partition of the nodes into two sets, S and T, where the source is in S and the sink is in T. The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from a node in S to a node in T.\n\nConsider the possible cuts:\n1.  **Cut 1: S = {0}, T = {1, 2}**\n    *   Edges from S to T: (0, 1) with capacity 5.\n    *   Cut Capacity = 5.\n2.  **Cut 2: S = {0, 1}, T = {2}**\n    *   Edges from S to T: (1, 2) with capacity 1.\n    *   Cut Capacity = 1.\n\nThe minimum of these cut capacities is 1. This matches the maximum flow we calculated, confirming the result.\n\nThe maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node (0) to the sink node (2) is **1**.",

Initialize the `max_flow` to 0.\n2.  Create a `residual_graph` which is initially a copy of the `capacity_matrix`. This graph stores the remaining capacity on edges.\n3.  While there exists an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the `residual_graph`:\n    a.  Use BFS to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges). During BFS, keep track of the `parent` of each node to reconstruct the path.\n    b.  If a path is found:\n        i.  Determine the `path_flow` (or bottleneck capacity) of this path, which is the minimum residual capacity of any edge in the path.\n        ii. Add `path_flow` to `max_flow`.\n        iii. For each edge `(u, v)` in the path:\n            - Decrease the residual capacity `residual_graph[u][v]` by `path_flow`.\n            - Increase the residual capacity of the reverse edge `residual_graph[v][u]` by `path_flow`.

Since the final `max_flow` is 11 and this matches a cut, the result is correct.\n\nThe final maximum flow is 11.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11}$",
