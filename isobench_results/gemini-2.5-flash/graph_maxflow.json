Initialize the total maximum flow (`max_flow`) to 0.\n2.  Create a residual capacity matrix (`residual_capacity`) which is initially identical to the given `capacity` matrix. This matrix stores the remaining capacity of edges. For every edge (u,v) with capacity C(u,v), we also implicitly consider a reverse edge (v,u) with initial residual capacity 0.\n3.

Initialize the flow for all edges to 0.\n2.  Maintain a residual graph, which initially is the same as the original graph's capacities.\n3.  Repeatedly find an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the residual graph using BFS.\n4.

The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of edges (u, v) where u ∈ S and v ∈ T.\n\nIn our final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source (0) is $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThe set of nodes not reachable from the source is $T = \\{4\\}$.\n\nLet's sum the capacities of edges in the *original* network that go from a node in S to a node in T:\n- Edge (0, 4): Capacity = 4\n- Edge (1, 4): Capacity = 5\n- Edge (2, 4): Capacity = 9\n- Edge (3, 4): Capacity = 1\n\nTotal cut capacity = $4 + 5 + 9 + 1 = 19$.\n\nSince the max flow found (19) equals the min cut capacity (19), our result is consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{19}$.",

Using BFS ensures that the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) is found in the residual graph, which guarantees termination for integer capacities and provides a polynomial time complexity.\n\n**Network Representation:**\n- Source node: `s = 0`\n- Sink node: `t = 3`\n- Capacity Matrix `C`:\n  ```\n  Nodes: 0  1  2  3\n       0 [0, 0, 7, 3]\n       1 [0, 0, 0, 5]\n       2 [0, 4, 0, 3]\n       3 [0, 0, 0, 0]\n  ```\n  (e.g., `C[0][2] = 7` means capacity from node 0 to node 2 is 7)\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.

The network is represented by a capacity matrix where `capacity_matrix[i][j]` denotes the maximum capacity of the edge from node `i` to node `j`. A value of 0 means no direct edge.\n\nThis is a classic maximum flow problem, which can be solved using the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm**. A common implementation of Ford-Fulkerson that guarantees polynomial time complexity is the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, which uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths in the residual graph.\n\n**Algorithm Steps (Edmonds-Karp):**\n1.  Initialize the total flow `max_flow_value` to 0.\n2.  Create a **residual graph** `R`, which is initially a copy of the capacity matrix. `R[u][v]` represents the remaining capacity of the edge `(u, v)`.\n3.  While an augmenting path (a path from source to sink with positive residual capacity) exists in the residual graph:\n    a.  Use BFS to find a path from the source node to the sink node in the residual graph. During BFS, keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path.\n    b.  If no path is found, terminate the algorithm.\n    c.  If a path is found, determine the **bottleneck capacity** (the minimum residual capacity) along this path. This is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through this path.\n    d.  Add the bottleneck capacity to `max_flow_value`.\n    e.  For each edge `(u, v)` in the found path:\n        i. Decrease the residual capacity `R[u][v]` by the bottleneck capacity.\n        ii.

But from source 0, no path to 4 can be found.\n\n*   **No augmenting path found.**\n\n**Final Maximum Flow:** The algorithm terminates.\n\n**Total Flow Calculation:**\nThe total flow can be seen as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source node:\n*   Flow (0,1) = 1\n*   Flow (0,2) = 7\n*   Flow (0,3) = 1\n*   Flow (0,4) = 2\nTotal flow = 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 11.\n\nAlternatively, sum of flows entering the sink node:\n*   Flow (0,4) = 2\n*   Flow (1,4) = 1\n*   Flow (2,4) = 7\n*   Flow (3,4) = 1\nTotal flow = 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 11.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe maximum flow from source node 0 to sink node 4 is **11**.",

This strategy helps ensure the algorithm's polynomial time complexity and prevents it from getting stuck in long, redundant paths.\n4.  **Bottleneck Capacity:** For each augmenting path found, the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed is limited by the minimum capacity of any edge along that path (the \"bottleneck\").\n5.  **Flow Augmentation:** Once the bottleneck capacity is determined, that amount of flow is added to the total `max_flow`. The actual flow on the edges in the network is updated: increased for forward edges and decreased for backward edges (which effectively increases their reverse capacity in the residual graph).\n6.  **Termination:** The process repeats until BFS can no longer find any path from the source to the sink, indicating that the maximum flow has been achieved (by the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, at this point, the minimum cut will be saturated).\n\nFollowing these steps, as demonstrated in the manual trace and the provided code, leads to a maximum flow of 9 for the given network.\n\nThe maximum flow from source 0 to sink 3 is: 9",

While an augmenting path (a path from source to sink with positive residual capacity) can be found in `R` using BFS:\n    a.

The sum of flows pushed along all found paths is the maximum flow.\n1.  Initially, flow 3 is sent directly from 0 to 3.\n2.  Then, flow 2 is sent along the path 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3.\n3.  No further paths can be found with positive residual capacity, indicating that the max flow has been reached. The total flow is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nThis result aligns with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, where a cut separating {0,2} from {1,3} has a capacity of $C(0,3) + C(2,1) = 3 + 2 = 5$.",

By updating the residual capacities (decreasing for forward edges, increasing for backward edges), it correctly models the available capacity. When no more paths can be found, the total accumulated flow represents the maximum possible flow in the network. In this case, the sum of capacities of edges originating from the source (0->1, 0->3, 0->4) is 4+3+9=16, and all these edges were saturated, forming an s-t cut whose capacity equals the max flow, consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.",

By updating residual capacities, it correctly accounts for both forward flow and the possibility of canceling previously sent flow (via backward edges). When no more paths can be found, it means the network is saturated, and the total accumulated flow is the maximum possible. This result is guaranteed by the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, which states that the maximum flow is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut separating the source from the sink. In our final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source is just `{0}`, while the remaining nodes `{1, 2, 3}` form the other partition of the cut. The sum of capacities of edges from `{0}` to `{1, 2, 3}` is `C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17`, which matches the maximum flow.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{17}$.",

The flow through a series of pipes is limited by the narrowest pipe.\n*   The capacity from node 0 to node 1 is 6.\n*   The capacity from node 1 to node 2 is 4.\nThe maximum amount of \"stuff\" that can flow through this series of connections is limited by the edge with the smallest capacity, which is the edge (1, 2) with a capacity of 4.\n\nThis aligns with the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem, where the maximum flow is equal to the minimum capacity of an S-T cut. In this case, the cut separating {0, 1} from {2} (which only cuts edge (1,2)) has a capacity of 4, and this is the minimum cut.",

The `max_flow` variable holds the maximum flow that can be sent from the source to the sink.\n\n**Final Maximum Flow:** `7`\n\n**Verification (Min-Cut):**\nAccording to the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, the maximum flow is equal to the minimum cut. A min-cut divides the graph into two sets of nodes (S, T) where the source is in S and the sink is in T. The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T. In the final residual graph, S is the set of nodes reachable from the source, and T is the rest.\n\n*   In the final `residual_capacity` matrix, perform BFS from source 0:\n    *   From 0, no edges have positive residual capacity (all `residual_capacity[0][v]` are 0).\n    *   Therefore, the only node reachable from 0 is 0 itself.\n*   So, `S = {0}`\n*   And `T = {1, 2}`\n\nNow, sum the capacities of original edges going from a node in S to a node in T:\n*   Edge (0, 1): Capacity = 2 (0 is in S, 1 is in T)\n*   Edge (0, 2): Capacity = 5 (0 is in S, 2 is in T)\n*   Total cut capacity = `C(0,1) + C(0,2) = 2 + 5 = 7`.\n\nThe maximum flow (7) equals the minimum cut capacity (7), which confirms our result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$",

A cut (S, T) partitions the nodes into two sets, S (containing the source) and T (containing the sink). The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T.\n\nAfter the algorithm terminates, the set of nodes reachable from the source (0) in the residual graph `R` forms the set `S` of the min-cut, and the unreachable nodes form `T`.\n\nLet's perform a BFS from the source (0) in the final residual graph `R` to find reachable nodes:\n*   Start BFS from 0. Queue: `[0]`. Visited: `{0}`.\n*   Dequeue 0. Neighbors with `R[0][v] > 0`: None (all `R[0][v]` are 0).\n*   Queue is empty.\n\nSo, the set of reachable nodes `S = {0}`.\nThe set of unreachable nodes (including the sink) `T = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nNow, let's sum the capacities of edges in the original graph that go from a node in `S` to a node in `T`:\n*   `C[0][1] = 3`\n*   `C[0][2] = 6`\n*   `C[0][3] = 5`\n*   `C[0][4] = 3`\n\nTotal cut capacity = `3 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 17`.\nThis matches the calculated `max_flow`, confirming the correctness of the result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{17}$.",

The max flow equals the min cut capacity.\n\nFrom the final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source `0` are `S = {0, 1, 2}`.\n(To check: Start BFS from 0 in the final residual graph. From 0, can reach 1 (cap 3) and 2 (cap 4). From 1, can reach 0 (cap 4). From 2, can reach 0 (cap 4) and 1 (cap 9). No other nodes are reachable.)\n\nThe set of unreachable nodes `T = {3, 4}`. Note that the sink `4` is in `T`, confirming that `S` is indeed the source side of a cut.\n\nCalculate the capacity of this cut (sum of original capacities of edges from `S` to `T`):\nEdges from `S = {0, 1, 2}` to `T = {3, 4}`:\n*   `C[0][3] = 4`\n*   `C[0][4] = 9`\n*   `C[1][4] = 4`\n*   `C[2][4] = 4`\n\nTotal cut capacity = `4 + 9 + 4 + 4 = 21`.\n\nThis matches the maximum flow calculated, confirming the result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{21}$.",

This process continues until no more paths can be found.\n\n**Step 1: Initial State**\n*   Current total flow = 0.\n*   All edge flows are 0.\n\n**Step 2: Find an Augmenting Path**\n*   We can see a path: `0 -> 1 -> 2`.\n*   Let's determine the bottleneck capacity along this path:\n    *   Capacity of edge (0, 1) = 5\n    *   Capacity of edge (1, 2) = 1\n*   The minimum capacity on this path is 1 (due to edge 1 -> 2). This is our `path_flow`.\n\n**Step 3: Augment Flow**\n*   Increase the flow along the path by `path_flow = 1`.\n    *   Flow on (0, 1) increases by 1 (current flow becomes 1).\n    *   Flow on (1, 2) increases by 1 (current flow becomes 1).\n*   Add `path_flow` to the total flow.\n    *   Total flow = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n**Step 4: Check for More Augmenting Paths**\n*   Now, let's look at the residual capacities:\n    *   Edge (0, 1): Original capacity 5, current flow 1. Residual capacity = 5 - 1 = 4.\n    *   Edge (1, 2): Original capacity 1, current flow 1. Residual capacity = 1 - 1 = 0.\n*   Is there any path from source (0) to sink (2) using only edges with positive residual capacity?\n    *   From 0, we can go to 1 (residual capacity 4).\n    *   From 1, we cannot go to 2 because the residual capacity of (1, 2) is now 0.\n*   No other paths exist. Therefore, no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe algorithm terminates. The maximum flow found is 1.\n\n**Verification using Min-Cut Max-Flow Theorem:**\nThe Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem states that the maximum flow in a network is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut. A cut is a partition of the nodes into two sets, S and T, where the source is in S and the sink is in T. The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from a node in S to a node in T.\n\nConsider the possible cuts:\n1.  **Cut 1: S = {0}, T = {1, 2}**\n    *   Edges from S to T: (0, 1) with capacity 5.\n    *   Cut Capacity = 5.\n2.  **Cut 2: S = {0, 1}, T = {2}**\n    *   Edges from S to T: (1, 2) with capacity 1.\n    *   Cut Capacity = 1.\n\nThe minimum of these cut capacities is 1. This matches the maximum flow we calculated, confirming the result.\n\nThe maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node (0) to the sink node (2) is **1**.",

Initialize the `max_flow` to 0.\n2.  Create a `residual_graph` which is initially a copy of the `capacity_matrix`. This graph stores the remaining capacity on edges.\n3.  While there exists an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the `residual_graph`:\n    a.  Use BFS to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges). During BFS, keep track of the `parent` of each node to reconstruct the path.\n    b.  If a path is found:\n        i.  Determine the `path_flow` (or bottleneck capacity) of this path, which is the minimum residual capacity of any edge in the path.\n        ii. Add `path_flow` to `max_flow`.\n        iii. For each edge `(u, v)` in the path:\n            - Decrease the residual capacity `residual_graph[u][v]` by `path_flow`.\n            - Increase the residual capacity of the reverse edge `residual_graph[v][u]` by `path_flow`.

      "model_response": "To find the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a flow network, we can use the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method.\n\nThe Edmonds-Karp algorithm works as follows:\n1.  Initialize the total flow to 0.\n2.  Create a **residual graph** which initially is identical to the given capacity graph. The residual graph keeps track of the remaining capacity on each edge and also adds \"backward\" edges for flow that has already been sent (allowing us to reroute flow if a better path is found later).\n3.  Repeatedly find an **augmenting path** from the source to the sink in the residual graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS guarantees that the shortest augmenting path (in terms of number of edges) is found, which helps in theoretical convergence.\n4.  If an augmenting path is found:\n    a.  Determine the **bottleneck capacity** (or `path_flow`) of this path. This is the minimum residual capacity of any edge along the path.\n    b.  Add this `path_flow` to the total maximum flow.\n    c.  Update the residual graph:\n        i.  For each edge (u, v) on the path, decrease its residual capacity `residual_graph[u][v]` by `path_flow`.\n        ii. For each edge (u, v) on the path, increase the residual capacity of its corresponding backward edge `residual_graph[v][u]` by `path_flow`.\n5.

By maintaining a residual graph and allowing \"backward\" flow (by increasing capacity on reverse edges), it can correct suboptimal flow assignments made earlier. The BFS ensures that the shortest path is chosen, which guarantees termination and polynomial time complexity. According to the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, the maximum flow in a network is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut. When the algorithm terminates, the nodes reachable from the source in the residual graph form one side of the min-cut, and the unreachable nodes form the other side, and the sum of capacities of edges going from the source side to the sink side will equal the total flow found.\n\nOur step-by-step calculation consistently added flow until no more paths could be found in the residual graph.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{13}$",

All other entries are 0, meaning there are no other edges, especially no outgoing edges from node 1 or node 2. (e.g., `capacity[1][0]=0`, `capacity[1][1]=0`, `capacity[1][2]=0`, etc.)\n\n**Analyzing the Paths from Source to Sink:**\nWe need to find paths from the source (node 0) to the sink (node 2).\n\n1.  **Path 1: 0 -> 2**\n    *   This is a direct path from the source to the sink.\n    *   The capacity of this path is limited by the capacity of the edge (0, 2), which is 8.\n    *   So, we can send a maximum of 8 units of flow along this path.\n\n2.  **Path through node 1 (e.g., 0 -> 1 -> ... -> 2)**\n    *   There is an edge from 0 to 1 with capacity 9.\n    *   However, looking at the capacity matrix row for node 1 (`[0, 0, 0]`), we see that there are no outgoing edges from node 1 to any other node (including the sink node 2).\n    *   This means any flow reaching node 1 cannot proceed further towards the sink. Therefore, paths starting with 0 -> 1 cannot reach the sink.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only effective path from the source node 0 to the sink node 2 is the direct edge 0 -> 2. The maximum flow that can be sent through this path is limited by its capacity, which is 8. Since no other paths exist that can deliver flow to the sink, the total maximum flow in the network is 8.\n\n**Maximum Flow:** 8\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n1.  Identify all edges and their capacities from the given matrix.\n2.  List all possible paths from the source (0) to the sink (2).\n3.  For each path, determine the bottleneck capacity (minimum edge capacity in the path).\n4.  In this network, the only path from source 0 to sink 2 is the direct edge (0, 2).\n5.  The capacity of edge (0, 2) is 8.\n6.  Node 1 has no outgoing edges, meaning any flow sent to node 1 from node 0 cannot reach the sink node 2.\n7.  Therefore, the maximum flow is limited by the capacity of the direct path, which is 8.",

      "model_response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum flow from a source node (0) to a sink node (4) in a given flow network represented by a capacity matrix. We will use the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, which is a classic approach for solving the maximum flow problem.\n\nThe Edmonds-Karp algorithm works by repeatedly finding augmenting paths from the source to the sink in the residual graph and pushing as much flow as possible along these paths until no more paths can be found. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is used to find the shortest augmenting path (in terms of number of edges), which guarantees termination and polynomial time complexity.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** Set the total `max_flow` to 0. Create a `residual_graph` which initially is identical to the `capacity_matrix`. For every existing edge (u, v) with capacity `C[u][v]`, there is a corresponding edge (u, v) in the residual graph with capacity `C[u][v]`. For every pair (u, v) where `C[u][v] = 0` (no direct edge), implicitly `residual_graph[u][v] = 0`. Also, for every (u, v), we conceptually have a back-edge (v, u) in the residual graph with initial capacity 0.\n\n2.  **Find Augmenting Path:** Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from the `source` (0) to the `sink` (4) in the current `residual_graph`. BFS explores edges only if their residual capacity is greater than 0. During BFS, keep track of the `parent` of each node to reconstruct the path.\n\n3.  **Calculate Bottleneck Capacity:** If an augmenting path is found, determine the minimum residual capacity along this path. This minimum capacity is the \"bottleneck capacity\" (or `path_flow`) that can be pushed through this path.\n\n4.  **Update Residual Graph and Flow:**\n    *   For each edge (u, v) in the augmenting path:\n        *   Decrease the residual capacity of the forward edge `residual_graph[u][v]` by `path_flow`.\n        *   Increase the residual capacity of the back-edge `residual_graph[v][u]` by `path_flow`. (This allows for \"canceling\" flow if a better path is found later).\n    *   Add `path_flow` to the `max_flow`.\n\n5.  **Repeat:** Continue steps 2-4 until BFS can no longer find an augmenting path from the source to the sink.\n\n6.  **Return:** The final `max_flow` value.\n\n---\n\n**Let's trace the Edmonds-Karp algorithm with the given network:**\n\n**Network Details:**\n*   Capacity Matrix `C`:\n    ```\n    [[0, 8, 4, 6, 7],   # Node 0\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],   # Node 1\n     [0, 1, 0, 0, 8],   # Node 2\n     [0, 6, 6, 0, 8],   # Node 3\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Node 4\n    ```\n*   Source Node `s = 0`\n*   Sink Node `t = 4`\n*   Initial `max_flow = 0`\n*   Initial `residual_graph` is a copy of `C`.\n\n---\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n*   **BFS finds path:** `0 -> 4`\n*   **Bottleneck capacity:** `min(C[0][4]) = min(7) = 7`\n*   **Update:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][4]` becomes `7 - 7 = 0`\n    *   `residual_graph[4][0]` becomes `0 + 7 = 7` (back-edge)\n    *   `max_flow = 0 + 7 = 7`\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n*   **BFS finds path:** `0 -> 1 -> 4`\n*   **Bottleneck capacity:** `min(residual_graph[0][1], residual_graph[1][4]) = min(8, 1) = 1`\n*   **Update:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][1]` becomes `8 - 1 = 7`\n    *   `residual_graph[1][4]` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`\n    *   `residual_graph[1][0]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1` (back-edge)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][1]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1` (back-edge)\n    *   `max_flow = 7 + 1 = 8`\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n*   **BFS finds path:** `0 -> 2 -> 4`\n*   **Bottleneck capacity:** `min(residual_graph[0][2], residual_graph[2][4]) = min(4, 8) = 4`\n*   **Update:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][2]` becomes `4 - 4 = 0`\n    *   `residual_graph[2][4]` becomes `8 - 4 = 4`\n    *   `residual_graph[2][0]` becomes `0 + 4 = 4` (back-edge)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][2]` becomes `0 + 4 = 4` (back-edge)\n    *   `max_flow = 8 + 4 = 12`\n\n**Iteration 4:**\n*   **BFS finds path:** `0 -> 3 -> 4`\n*   **Bottleneck capacity:** `min(residual_graph[0][3], residual_graph[3][4]) = min(6, 8) = 6`\n*   **Update:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][3]` becomes `6 - 6 = 0`\n    *   `residual_graph[3][4]` becomes `8 - 6 = 2`\n    *   `residual_graph[3][0]` becomes `0 + 6 = 6` (back-edge)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][3]` becomes `0 + 6 = 6` (back-edge)\n    *   `max_flow = 12 + 6 = 18`\n\n**Iteration 5:**\n*   **Current Residual Graph (relevant capacities for BFS from 0):**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][1] = 7` (from original 8, 1 used)\n    *   `residual_graph[0][2] = 0` (all 4 used)\n    *   `residual_graph[0][3] = 0` (all 6 used)\n    *   `residual_graph[0][4] = 0` (all 7 used)\n\n*   **BFS from 0:**\n    *   From node 0, the only outgoing edge with positive residual capacity is `0 -> 1` (capacity 7).\n    *   From node 1, there is no direct edge to node 4 with positive residual capacity (`residual_graph[1][4] = 0`).

At this point, all paths from the source to the sink are saturated. The only remaining path from 0 is `0 -> 1` (capacity 1), but from 1 there is no path to 2 (capacity `R[1][2]` is 0). Therefore, no more flow can be sent.\n6.  Total flow = 5 + 8 = 13.\n\nThis result aligns with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem. If we consider the cut `S = {0, 1}` and `T = {2}` (where S contains the source and T contains the sink), the edges crossing this cut from S to T are `(0, 2)` and `(1, 2)`. Their original capacities are `C[0][2] = 8` and `C[1][2] = 5`. The capacity of this cut is `8 + 5 = 13`. Since the maximum flow equals the minimum cut capacity, and we found a flow of 13, this is indeed the maximum flow.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",

We will use the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths.\n\n**Algorithm Steps (Edmonds-Karp):**\n\n1.  **Initialize Flow:** Set the initial maximum flow `max_flow = 0`. Create a residual graph, which initially is the same as the capacity graph.\n    *   The residual capacity $R[u][v]$ for an edge $(u,v)$ is initially its capacity $C[u][v]$.\n    *   For every edge $(u,v)$ with capacity $C[u][v]$, we also consider a \"reverse\" edge $(v,u)$ with initial residual capacity $0$. This reverse edge allows us to \"undo\" flow if a better path is found.\n\n2.  **Find Augmenting Path:** Repeatedly search for a path from the source to the sink in the *residual graph* where every edge has a positive residual capacity. BFS is used for this to find the shortest path in terms of number of edges.\n    *   During BFS, keep track of the `parent` node to reconstruct the path and the `path_flow` (the bottleneck capacity) up to each node.\n\n3.  **Augment Flow:** If an augmenting path is found:\n    *   Determine the `bottleneck_capacity` (the minimum residual capacity along the path).\n    *   Add this `bottleneck_capacity` to `max_flow`.\n    *   For each edge $(u,v)$ on the augmenting path:\n        *   Decrease the residual capacity $R[u][v]$ by `bottleneck_capacity`.\n        *   Increase the residual capacity $R[v][u]$ (of the reverse edge) by `bottleneck_capacity`. This allows flow to be pushed back.\n\n4.  **Repeat:** Continue steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n5.  **Result:** The final `max_flow` value is the maximum flow from source to sink.\n\n---\n\n**Network Representation:**\n\nCapacity Matrix `C`:\n```\n[[0, 1, 4, 6, 4],   // Node 0\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],   // Node 1\n [0, 9, 0, 0, 2],   // Node 2\n [0, 1, 3, 0, 1],   // Node 3\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  // Node 4 (Sink)\n```\nSource node: 0\nSink node: 4\nNumber of nodes: 5\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step Execution:**\n\nInitialize `max_flow = 0`.\nInitialize `Residual_Capacity_Matrix (R)` identical to `C`.\n\n**Initial Residual Capacity Matrix (R):**\n```\n[[0, 1, 4, 6, 4],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n [0, 9, 0, 0, 2],\n [0, 1, 3, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Iteration 1: Find Path 1**\n\nBFS from Source 0:\nPath found: `0 -> 4`\nBottleneck capacity: `R[0][4] = 4`.\nAugment flow by 4.\n`max_flow = 0 + 4 = 4`.\n\nUpdate `R`:\n`R[0][4] -= 4` (becomes 0)\n`R[4][0] += 4` (becomes 4)\n\n**R after Iteration 1:**\n```\n[[0, 1, 4, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n [0, 9, 0, 0, 2],\n [0, 1, 3, 0, 1],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Iteration 2: Find Path 2**\n\nBFS from Source 0:\nPath found: `0 -> 1 -> 4`\nBottleneck capacity: `min(R[0][1], R[1][4]) = min(1, 3) = 1`.\nAugment flow by 1.\n`max_flow = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nUpdate `R`:\n`R[0][1] -= 1` (becomes 0)\n`R[1][0] += 1` (becomes 1)\n`R[1][4] -= 1` (becomes 2)\n`R[4][1] += 1` (becomes 1)\n\n**R after Iteration 2:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 4, 6, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n [0, 9, 0, 0, 2],\n [0, 1, 3, 0, 1],\n [4, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Iteration 3: Find Path 3**\n\nBFS from Source 0:\nPath found: `0 -> 2 -> 4`\nBottleneck capacity: `min(R[0][2], R[2][4]) = min(4, 2) = 2`.\nAugment flow by 2.\n`max_flow = 5 + 2 = 7`.\n\nUpdate `R`:\n`R[0][2] -= 2` (becomes 2)\n`R[2][0] += 2` (becomes 2)\n`R[2][4] -= 2` (becomes 0)\n`R[4][2] += 2` (becomes 2)\n\n**R after Iteration 3:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 2, 6, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n [2, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 1, 3, 0, 1],\n [4, 1, 2, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Iteration 4: Find Path 4**\n\nBFS from Source 0:\nPath found: `0 -> 3 -> 4`\nBottleneck capacity: `min(R[0][3], R[3][4]) = min(6, 1) = 1`.\nAugment flow by 1.\n`max_flow = 7 + 1 = 8`.\n\nUpdate `R`:\n`R[0][3] -= 1` (becomes 5)\n`R[3][0] += 1` (becomes 1)\n`R[3][4] -= 1` (becomes 0)\n`R[4][3] += 1` (becomes 1)\n\n**R after Iteration 4:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 2, 5, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n [2, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 3, 0, 0],\n [4, 1, 2, 1, 0]]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Iteration 5: Find Path 5**\n\nBFS from Source 0:\nPath found: `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4`\nBottleneck capacities: `R[0][2]=2`, `R[2][1]=9`, `R[1][4]=2`.\nBottleneck capacity: `min(2, 9, 2) = 2`.\nAugment flow by 2.\n`max_flow = 8 + 2 = 10`.\n\nUpdate `R`:\n`R[0][2] -= 2` (becomes 0)\n`R[2][0] += 2` (becomes 4)\n`R[2][1] -= 2` (becomes 7)\n`R[1][2] += 2` (becomes 2)\n`R[1][4] -= 2` (becomes 0)\n`R[4][1] += 2` (becomes 3)\n\n**R after Iteration 5:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [1, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n [4, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 3, 0, 0],\n [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Iteration 6: Search for Path 6**\n\nBFS from Source 0 with current `R`:\n*   From 0: Only `0 -> 3` has `R[0][3] = 5 > 0`. `path_flow[3]=5`, `parent[3]=0`.

The set of nodes reachable from the source (0) in the final residual graph is `S_cut = {0, 1}`. Node 2 is not reachable from 0.\nThe other set of nodes is `T_cut = {2}`.\nThe capacity of this cut `(S_cut, T_cut)` is the sum of capacities of edges from `S_cut` to `T_cut` in the original graph:\n*   Edge `(0, 2)`: capacity `C(0,2) = 4`\n*   Edge `(1, 2)`: capacity `C(1,2) = 1`\nTotal cut capacity = `C(0,2) + C(1,2) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\nThis matches the `max_flow` found, confirming the result according to the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",

A cut (S, T) partitions the nodes into two sets, S (containing the source) and T (containing the sink). The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T in the *original* graph. In the final residual graph, S is the set of nodes reachable from the source, and T is the set of unreachable nodes.\n\nLet's find the reachable nodes from source 0 in the final `residual_graph`:\n*   Start BFS from 0:\n    *   Queue: `[0]`\n    *   From 0: No outgoing edges with capacity > 0.\n*   The only reachable node from 0 in the final residual graph is `0` itself.\n*   Therefore, `S = {0}` and `T = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the capacity of this cut in the *original* graph:\n*   Edges from S (node 0) to T ({1, 2, 3, 4}):\n    *   `0 -> 1`: Capacity 4\n    *   `0 -> 2`: Capacity 9\n    *   `0 -> 3`: Capacity 1\n    *   `0 -> 4`: Capacity 9\n*   Total cut capacity = 4 + 9 + 1 + 9 = 23.\n\nSince the maximum flow found (23) equals the capacity of this cut (23), our result is consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.\n\nThe maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node (0) to the sink node (4) is **23**.",

While an augmenting path from source to sink exists in the residual graph:\n    a.  Find an augmenting path using BFS.\n    b.  Determine the bottleneck capacity (minimum residual capacity) along this path.\n    c.  Increase the flow along the path by the bottleneck capacity.\n    d.  Update the residual capacities for forward and backward edges.\n3.  The algorithm terminates when no more augmenting paths can be found. The total flow accumulated is the maximum flow.\n\nLet `f[u][v]` denote the current flow from `u` to `v`.\nLet `res_cap[u][v]` denote the residual capacity from `u` to `v`. Initially, `res_cap[u][v] = C[u][v]`.\nFor each unit of flow `x` added from `u` to `v`:\n*   `f[u][v]` increases by `x`.\n*   `res_cap[u][v]` decreases by `x`.\n*   `res_cap[v][u]` (the capacity of the backward edge) increases by `x`.\n\nLet's trace the algorithm:\n\n**Initial State:**\n`flow = [[0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0]]`\n`total_flow = 0`\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n*   **Residual Graph (current `res_cap` is equal to `C`):**\n    ```\n    [[0, 7, 0, 3, 6],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 2, 0, 0, 8],\n     [0, 9, 8, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Find Path (BFS from Source 0 to Sink 4):**\n    A simple path: `0 -> 1 -> 4`\n    *   `res_cap[0][1] = 7`\n    *   `res_cap[1][4] = 2`\n*   **Bottleneck Capacity:** `min(7, 2) = 2`\n*   **Augment Flow:** Add 2 units of flow.\n    *   `f[0][1] = 2`\n    *   `f[1][4] = 2`\n    *   `total_flow = 0 + 2 = 2`\n*   **Update `res_cap`:**\n    *   `res_cap[0][1] = 7 - 2 = 5`\n    *   `res_cap[1][0] = 0 + 2 = 2` (backward edge)\n    *   `res_cap[1][4] = 2 - 2 = 0`\n    *   `res_cap[4][1] = 0 + 2 = 2` (backward edge)\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n*   **Current `res_cap` (relevant changes):**\n    `res_cap[0][1]=5`, `res_cap[1][0]=2`, `res_cap[1][4]=0`, `res_cap[4][1]=2`\n*   **Find Path (BFS):**\n    Path: `0 -> 3 -> 4`\n    *   `res_cap[0][3] = C[0][3] = 3`\n    *   `res_cap[3][4] = C[3][4] = 2`\n*   **Bottleneck Capacity:** `min(3, 2) = 2`\n*   **Augment Flow:** Add 2 units of flow.\n    *   `f[0][3] = 2`\n    *   `f[3][4] = 2`\n    *   `total_flow = 2 + 2 = 4`\n*   **Update `res_cap`:**\n    *   `res_cap[0][3] = 3 - 2 = 1`\n    *   `res_cap[3][0] = 0 + 2 = 2`\n    *   `res_cap[3][4] = 2 - 2 = 0`\n    *   `res_cap[4][3] = 0 + 2 = 2`\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n*   **Current `res_cap` (relevant changes):**\n    `res_cap[0][1]=5`, `res_cap[1][0]=2`, `res_cap[1][4]=0`, `res_cap[4][1]=2`\n    `res_cap[0][3]=1`, `res_cap[3][0]=2`, `res_cap[3][4]=0`, `res_cap[4][3]=2`\n*   **Find Path (BFS):**\n    Path: `0 -> 4` (direct edge)\n    *   `res_cap[0][4] = C[0][4] = 6`\n*   **Bottleneck Capacity:** `min(6) = 6`\n*   **Augment Flow:** Add 6 units of flow.\n    *   `f[0][4] = 6`\n    *   `total_flow = 4 + 6 = 10`\n*   **Update `res_cap`:**\n    *   `res_cap[0][4] = 6 - 6 = 0`\n    *   `res_cap[4][0] = 0 + 6 = 6`\n\n**Iteration 4:**\n*   **Current `res_cap` (updated matrix showing only non-zero values):**\n    `res_cap[0][1]=5`, `res_cap[0][3]=1`, `res_cap[0][4]=0`\n    `res_cap[1][0]=2`, `res_cap[1][4]=0`\n    `res_cap[2][1]=2`, `res_cap[2][4]=8`\n    `res_cap[3][0]=2`, `res_cap[3][1]=9`, `res_cap[3][2]=8`, `res_cap[3][4]=0`\n    `res_cap[4][0]=6`, `res_cap[4][1]=2`, `res_cap[4][3]=2`\n*   **Find Path (BFS):**\n    Path: `0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4`\n    *   `res_cap[0][3] = 1` (from previous updates)\n    *   `res_cap[3][2] = C[3][2] = 8`\n    *   `res_cap[2][4] = C[2][4] = 8`\n*   **Bottleneck Capacity:** `min(1, 8, 8) = 1`\n*   **Augment Flow:** Add 1 unit of flow.\n    *   `f[0][3] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n    *   `f[3][2] = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `f[2][4] = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `total_flow = 10 + 1 = 11`\n*   **Update `res_cap`:**\n    *   `res_cap[0][3] = 1 - 1 = 0`\n    *   `res_cap[3][0] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n    *   `res_cap[3][2] = 8 - 1 = 7`\n    *   `res_cap[2][3] = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `res_cap[2][4] = 8 - 1 = 7`\n    *   `res_cap[4][2] = 0 + 1 = 1`\n\n**Iteration 5:**\n*   **Current `res_cap` (matrix reflecting all updates):**\n    ```\n         0   1   2   3   4\n    0  [0,  5,  0,  0,  0]  (0->3 is 0, 0->4 is 0)\n    1  [2,  0,  0,  0,  0]  (1->4 is 0)\n    2  [0,  2,  0,  1,  7]  (2->3 is 1)\n    3  [3,  9,  7,  0,  0]  (3->0 is 3, 3->1 is 9, 3->2 is 7, 3->4 is 0)\n    4  [6,  2,  1,  2,  0]  (4->0 is 6, 4->1 is 2, 4->2 is 1, 4->3 is 2)\n    ```\n*   **Find Path (BFS):**\n    Perform a BFS starting from node 0.\n    1.

The nodes reachable from the source in the final residual graph form set S, and the rest form set T.\nIn our final BFS from Iteration 5: `S = {0, 1}`. Thus, `T = {2, 3, 4}`.\nThe cut edges (from S to T) are:\n*   `(0,3)`: Capacity `C[0][3] = 3`\n*   `(0,4)`: Capacity `C[0][4] = 6`\n*   `(1,4)`: Capacity `C[1][4] = 2`\nThe sum of capacities of edges crossing the cut (S, T) is `3 + 6 + 2 = 11`. This matches the maximum flow found.\n\nThe maximum flow from source node 0 to sink node 4 is **11**.",

The set of vertices `S` reachable from the source `s` in the final residual graph `R` forms one side of the min-cut, and `T = V \\ S` forms the other.\n\nIn our final state, when we perform the last BFS, only node 0 is reachable from 0 (since all its outgoing edges have 0 residual capacity).\nSo, `S = {0}` and `T = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nThe capacity of this cut (S, T) is the sum of capacities of edges `(u, v)` where `u` is in `S` and `v` is in `T` in the *original* graph.\nCut capacity = `C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] + C[0][4]`\nCut capacity = `3 + 5 + 8 + 8 = 24`\n\nSince the maximum flow (24) equals the capacity of this s-t cut (24), our result is confirmed.\n\nThe final maximum flow from source node 0 to sink node 4 is **24**.",

No path found to sink 3.\n\n---\n**Termination:**\nThe algorithm terminates as no more augmenting paths can be found.\nThe final `max_flow` is 14.\n\n**Final Flow Distribution:**\nTo verify, let's look at the flow out of the source (node 0) or into the sink (node 3).\nBased on the augmentations:\n- Flow `F[0][3] = 2`\n- Flow `F[0][1] = 6` (initially 0, increased by 6)\n- Flow `F[1][3] = 6` (initially 0, increased by 6)\n- Flow `F[0][2] = 6` (initially 0, increased by 6)\n- Flow `F[2][3] = 6` (initially 0, increased by 6)\n(Note: The edge (2,1) with capacity 5 was never used to push flow in the forward direction or reverse direction to cancel existing flow from 1 to 2 in this specific trace of augmenting paths, so `F[2][1]` remains 0.)\n\nTotal flow out of source (0): `F[0][1] + F[0][2] + F[0][3] = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14`.\nTotal flow into sink (3): `F[1][3] + F[2][3] + F[0][3] = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14`.\n\nThis result is consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem. The minimum cut would separate nodes {0, 1, 2} from {3}. The capacities of edges crossing this cut from {0,1,2} to {3} are:\n- `C[0][3] = 2`\n- `C[1][3] = 6`\n- `C[2][3] = 6`\nSumming these capacities: `2 + 6 + 6 = 14`.\n\nThe maximum flow is 14.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{14}$.",

      "model_response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum flow from a source node (0) to a sink node (3) in a given flow network. We will use the **Ford-Fulkerson method** with the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm** (which uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths) because it guarantees finding the maximum flow for networks with integer capacities.\n\n**Algorithm Overview (Edmonds-Karp):**\n\n1.  Initialize the total flow `F = 0`.\n2.  Initialize the residual graph `R` to be equal to the original capacity matrix `C`. This `R[u][v]` represents the remaining capacity from `u` to `v`. Also, for every edge `(u, v)` with capacity `C[u][v]`, we conceptually have a backward edge `(v, u)` with initial residual capacity `R[v][u] = 0`.\n3.  While there exists an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the residual graph `R`:\n    a.  **Find Path:** Use BFS to find a path from source (0) to sink (3) in the residual graph `R` such that all edges along the path have `R[u][v] > 0`. Keep track of the parent pointers to reconstruct the path.\n    b.  **Calculate Path Flow:** Determine the bottleneck capacity (the minimum residual capacity) along this path. This is the maximum flow `path_flow` that can be pushed along this path.\n    c.  **Update Residual Graph:** For each edge `(u, v)` in the found path:\n        *   Decrease the residual capacity of the forward edge: `R[u][v] -= path_flow`.\n        *   Increase the residual capacity of the backward edge: `R[v][u] += path_flow`. (This allows \"undoing\" flow if a better path is found later).\n    d.  **Add to Total Flow:** Add `path_flow` to the total flow `F`.\n4.

A cut divides the nodes into two sets, S and T, such that the source is in S and the sink is in T. The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from a node in S to a node in T.\n\nConsider the cut (S-side, T-side) where:\n*   S-side = {0}\n*   T-side = {1, 2}\nEdges crossing this cut from S-side to T-side are:\n*   (0, 1) with capacity 3\n*   (0, 2) with capacity 6\nCapacity of this cut = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nThis cut matches our calculated maximum flow. No other cut can have a smaller capacity in this network.

This means any flow sent from node 0 to node 1 cannot reach the sink. Therefore, the only path that can deliver flow from the source to the sink is the direct path `0 -> 2`. The maximum capacity of this path is 3. Once 3 units of flow are sent along this path, its capacity becomes 0, and no other paths exist or can be formed to increase the total flow.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

After the algorithm terminates, the set of nodes reachable from the source in the residual graph (S) and the set of nodes not reachable (T) define a minimum cut.\n\nIn the final residual graph:\n*   From source node 0, there are no outgoing edges with positive residual capacity (`residual_capacity[0][1]=0`, `residual_capacity[0][2]=0`).\n*   Therefore, the set of nodes reachable from the source is `S = {0}`.\n*   The set of nodes not reachable (including the sink) is `T = {1, 2}`.\n\nThe edges crossing this cut from S to T in the *original* graph are:\n*   Edge (0, 1) with original capacity 3.\n*   Edge (0, 2) with original capacity 6.\n\nThe capacity of this cut is `Capacity(0, 1) + Capacity(0, 2) = 3 + 6 = 9`.\n\nSince the max flow found (9) equals the capacity of this cut (9), our answer is consistent with the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem.\n\nThe maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node (0) to the sink node (2) is **9**.",

The remaining nodes form `T`.\n*   Performing a BFS from 0 on the final `R`:\n    *   0 can reach 1 (`R[0][1] = 3`).\n    *   From 1, no further nodes are reachable that can lead to 4.\n    *   0 cannot reach 2, 3, or 4 directly in `R` (their capacities `R[0][2]`, `R[0][3]`, `R[0][4]` are all 0).\n*   So, `S = {0, 1}` and `T = {2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The capacity of the cut (S, T) is the sum of capacities of edges `(u, v)` where `u` in `S` and `v` in `T` (using original capacities `C`):\n    *   `C[0][2] = 1`\n    *   `C[0][3] = 9`\n    *   `C[0][4] = 6`\n    *   `C[1][2] = 0`\n    *   `C[1][3] = 0`\n    *   `C[1][4] = 5`\n*   Cut capacity = `1 + 9 + 6 + 5 = 21`.\nThis matches the total flow, confirming the result by the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.\n\nThe maximum flow from source node 0 to sink node 4 is 21.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{21}$",

      "model_response": "To find the maximum flow from the source node (0) to the sink node (4) in the given flow network, we will use the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**. This algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths in the residual graph. Using BFS ensures that the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) is always chosen, which guarantees termination in polynomial time for integer capacities.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Initialize the `flow` to 0.\n2.  Create a `residual_graph` which is initially identical to the `capacity_matrix`. This graph represents the remaining capacity on each edge. For every edge (u, v) with capacity C(u,v), a corresponding reverse edge (v, u) is added to the residual graph with initial capacity 0.\n3.  Repeatedly search for an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the `residual_graph` using BFS. An augmenting path is a path where all edges have a residual capacity greater than 0.\n4.  If a path is found:\n    a.  Determine the `path_flow` (bottleneck capacity) by finding the minimum residual capacity along any edge in the path.\n    b.  Add `path_flow` to the total `flow`.\n    c.  For each edge (u, v) in the path, decrease `residual_capacity[u][v]` by `path_flow` and increase `residual_capacity[v][u]` by `path_flow`. This accounts for the flow sent and allows for potential \"undoing\" of flow (sending flow back) if a better path is found later.\n5.  If no augmenting path can be found, the algorithm terminates, and the current `flow` is the maximum flow.\n\n**Network Details:**\n*   **Nodes:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n*   **Source Node:** 0\n*   **Sink Node:** 4\n*   **Capacity Matrix:**\n    ```\n    [[0, 1, 2, 4, 7],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n     [0, 9, 0, 0, 5],\n     [0, 7, 7, 0, 4],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n**Initial State:**\n*   `flow = 0`\n*   `residual_graph` (initialized with capacities, reverse edges initially 0):\n    ```\n    [[0, 1, 2, 4, 7],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n     [0, 9, 0, 0, 5],\n     [0, 7, 7, 0, 4],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n*   **BFS from source (0):**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 4` (Direct path to sink)\n*   **Path flow:** `min(residual_graph[0][4]) = min(7) = 7`\n*   **Update flow:** `flow = 0 + 7 = 7`\n*   **Update residual_graph:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][4] -= 7` (becomes 0)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][0] += 7` (becomes 7)\n\n`residual_graph` after Iteration 1:\n```\n[[0, 1, 2, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [0, 9, 0, 0, 5],\n [0, 7, 7, 0, 4],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nCurrent `flow = 7`\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n*   **BFS from source (0):**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 1 -> 4`\n*   **Path flow:** `min(residual_graph[0][1], residual_graph[1][4]) = min(1, 8) = 1`\n*   **Update flow:** `flow = 7 + 1 = 8`\n*   **Update residual_graph:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][1] -= 1` (becomes 0)\n    *   `residual_graph[1][0] += 1` (becomes 1)\n    *   `residual_graph[1][4] -= 1` (becomes 7)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][1] += 1` (becomes 1)\n\n`residual_graph` after Iteration 2:\n```\n[[0, 0, 2, 4, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 7],\n [0, 9, 0, 0, 5],\n [0, 7, 7, 0, 4],\n [7, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nCurrent `flow = 8`\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n*   **BFS from source (0):**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 2 -> 4`\n*   **Path flow:** `min(residual_graph[0][2], residual_graph[2][4]) = min(2, 5) = 2`\n*   **Update flow:** `flow = 8 + 2 = 10`\n*   **Update residual_graph:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][2] -= 2` (becomes 0)\n    *   `residual_graph[2][0] += 2` (becomes 2)\n    *   `residual_graph[2][4] -= 2` (becomes 3)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][2] += 2` (becomes 2)\n\n`residual_graph` after Iteration 3:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 7],\n [2, 9, 0, 0, 3],\n [0, 7, 7, 0, 4],\n [7, 1, 2, 0, 0]]\n```\nCurrent `flow = 10`\n\n**Iteration 4:**\n*   **BFS from source (0):**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 3 -> 4`\n*   **Path flow:** `min(residual_graph[0][3], residual_graph[3][4]) = min(4, 4) = 4`\n*   **Update flow:** `flow = 10 + 4 = 14`\n*   **Update residual_graph:**\n    *   `residual_graph[0][3] -= 4` (becomes 0)\n    *   `residual_graph[3][0] += 4` (becomes 4)\n    *   `residual_graph[3][4] -= 4` (becomes 0)\n    *   `residual_graph[4][3] += 4` (becomes 4)\n\n`residual_graph` after Iteration 4:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  <- All outgoing edges from 0 now have 0 residual capacity\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 7],\n [2, 9, 0, 0, 3],\n [4, 7, 7, 0, 0],\n [7, 1, 2, 4, 0]]\n```\nCurrent `flow = 14`\n\n**Iteration 5:**\n*   **BFS from source (0):**\n    *   Attempt to find a path from 0 to 4.\n    *   Node 0 has no outgoing edges with positive residual capacity (`residual_graph[0][1]`, `[0][2]`, `[0][3]`, `[0][4]` are all 0).\n    *   No path can be found to the sink.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe algorithm terminates as no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow from source (0) to sink (4) is **14**.\n\n**Summary of Flow paths:**\n*   Path 1: $0 \\to 4$ (flow = 7)\n*   Path 2: $0 \\to 1 \\to 4$ (flow = 1)\n*   Path 3: $0 \\to 2 \\to 4$ (flow = 2)\n*   Path 4: $0 \\to 3 \\to 4$ (flow = 4)\nTotal Flow = $7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14$.",

An S-T cut is a partition of the vertices into two sets, S and T, such that the source `s` is in S and the sink `t` is in T. The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges (u,v) where `u` is in S and `v` is in T.\n\nIn the final residual graph, the set of nodes reachable from the source (0) is S, and the rest are T.\nLet's find reachable nodes from 0 in the final residual graph:\n*   From 0, we can reach 1 (`res_cap[0][1] = 3 > 0`).\n*   From 1, we cannot reach 3 (`res_cap[1][3] = 0`).\n*   Nodes 2 and 3 are not reachable from 0.\n\nSo, the set of reachable nodes `S = {0, 1}`.\nThe set of non-reachable nodes `T = {2, 3}`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the capacity of the cut (S, T) using the *original* capacities for edges from S to T:\n*   Edges from S (`{0, 1}`) to T (`{2, 3}`):\n    *   From node 0:\n        *   `capacity[0][2] = 6`\n        *   `capacity[0][3] = 5`\n    *   From node 1:\n        *   `capacity[1][2] = 0`\n        *   `capacity[1][3] = 5`\n\n*   Total cut capacity = `capacity[0][2] + capacity[0][3] + capacity[1][3]`\n*   Total cut capacity = `6 + 5 + 5 = 16`\n\nSince the maximum flow (16) equals the minimum cut capacity (16), our solution is consistent with the theorem.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

For every edge `(u,v)` with capacity `C[u][v]`, there is also a backward edge `(v,u)` with initial residual capacity `0`. When flow is sent along `(u,v)`, `R[u][v]` decreases, and `R[v][u]` increases.\n3.  **Find Augmenting Path:** Repeatedly perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the residual graph `R` to find a path from `s` to `t`. A path exists if there's a sequence of nodes `s -> v1 -> v2 -> ... -> t` such that `R[s][v1] > 0`, `R[v1][v2] > 0`, and so on.\n4.  **Calculate Bottleneck Capacity:** If a path `P` is found, determine its bottleneck capacity, which is the minimum residual capacity of any edge in `P`. Let this be `path_flow`.\n5.  **Augment Flow:**\n    *   Add `path_flow` to `max_flow`.\n    *   For each edge `(u,v)` in path `P`:\n        *   Decrease `R[u][v]` by `path_flow`.\n        *   Increase `R[v][u]` (the capacity of the backward edge) by `path_flow`.\n6.  **Repeat:** Continue from Step 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found (BFS fails to reach `t`).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n**Initial State:**\n`max_flow = 0`\n`Residual Graph (R)` is initially the same as `C`:\n```\nR = [[0, 1, 9, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 8],\n     [0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n*   **BFS from 0 to 3:**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 3`\n    *   Edges in path: `(0,3)`\n    *   Bottleneck capacity: `min(R[0][3]) = min(2) = 2`\n*   **Augment Flow:**\n    *   `max_flow = 0 + 2 = 2`\n    *   Update `R`:\n        *   `R[0][3] -= 2` => `R[0][3] = 0`\n        *   `R[3][0] += 2` => `R[3][0] = 2` (backward edge)\n*   **Current R:**\n    ```\n    R = [[0, 1, 9, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 8],\n         [0, 0, 0, 2],\n         [2, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n*   **BFS from 0 to 3:**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 1 -> 3`\n    *   Edges in path: `(0,1), (1,3)`\n    *   Bottleneck capacity: `min(R[0][1], R[1][3]) = min(1, 8) = 1`\n*   **Augment Flow:**\n    *   `max_flow = 2 + 1 = 3`\n    *   Update `R`:\n        *   `R[0][1] -= 1` => `R[0][1] = 0`\n        *   `R[1][0] += 1` => `R[1][0] = 1`\n        *   `R[1][3] -= 1` => `R[1][3] = 7`\n        *   `R[3][1] += 1` => `R[3][1] = 1`\n*   **Current R:**\n    ```\n    R = [[0, 0, 9, 0],\n         [1, 0, 0, 7],\n         [0, 0, 0, 2],\n         [2, 1, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n*   **BFS from 0 to 3:**\n    *   Path found: `0 -> 2 -> 3`\n    *   Edges in path: `(0,2), (2,3)`\n    *   Bottleneck capacity: `min(R[0][2], R[2][3]) = min(9, 2) = 2`\n*   **Augment Flow:**\n    *   `max_flow = 3 + 2 = 5`\n    *   Update `R`:\n        *   `R[0][2] -= 2` => `R[0][2] = 7`\n        *   `R[2][0] += 2` => `R[2][0] = 2`\n        *   `R[2][3] -= 2` => `R[2][3] = 0`\n        *   `R[3][2] += 2` => `R[3][2] = 2`\n*   **Current R:**\n    ```\n    R = [[0, 0, 7, 0],\n         [1, 0, 0, 7],\n         [2, 0, 0, 0],\n         [2, 1, 2, 0]]\n    ```\n\n**Iteration 4:**\n*   **BFS from 0 to 3:**\n    *   Start BFS from 0.\n    *   Can go to 2 (`R[0][2]=7`).

The algorithm terminates.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe maximum flow is the final `max_flow` value, which is **5**.\n\n**Verification (Min-Cut):**\n\nAccording to the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, the maximum flow value is equal to the capacity of a minimum cut. A min-cut partitions the nodes into two sets, S (containing the source) and T (containing the sink), such that the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T is minimized. The nodes reachable from the source in the final residual graph with positive residual capacity form the set S of a min-cut.\n\nFrom the final `R`:\n```\nR = [[0, 0, 7, 0],\n     [1, 0, 0, 7],\n     [2, 0, 0, 0],\n     [2, 1, 2, 0]]\n```\nBFS from source (0) in `R`:\n*   Node 0 is reachable.\n*   From 0, can reach 2 (since `R[0][2] = 7 > 0`).\n*   From 2, can reach 0 (since `R[2][0] = 2 > 0`), but 0 is already in S. No other node is reachable from 2 that is not already in S.\n*   Nodes 1 and 3 are not reachable from 0 in this final residual graph.\n\nSo, `S = {0, 2}` and `T = {1, 3}`.\n\nNow, calculate the capacity of the cut (S, T) using the *original capacities* `C`:\nEdges from S to T:\n*   (0,1): `C[0][1] = 1`\n*   (0,3): `C[0][3] = 2`\n*   (2,3): `C[2][3] = 2` (Note: `C[2][1]=0`, so not included)\n\nTotal cut capacity = `C[0][1] + C[0][3] + C[2][3] = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`.\n\nThe max flow (5) matches the min cut capacity (5), which confirms the result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",

After the algorithm terminates, the set of nodes `S` reachable from the source `s` in the residual graph forms one side of the min-cut, and `T = V \\ S` forms the other.\n\nIn our final `residual_capacity` graph, a BFS from node 0 can reach nodes {0, 1, 2, 3}. Node 4 is not reachable.\nSo, `S = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and `T = {4}`.\n\nNow, calculate the capacity of the cut (S, T) using the *original capacities* of edges going from a node in S to a node in T:\n- Edge (0, 4): Capacity `C[0][4] = 7`\n- Edge (1, 4): Capacity `C[1][4] = 1`\n- Edge (2, 4): Capacity `C[2][4] = 1`\n- Edge (3, 4): Capacity `C[3][4] = 1`\n\nTotal cut capacity = `7 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10`.\nSince the maximum flow (10) equals the minimum cut capacity (10), our result is confirmed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10}$",

It's an edge out of the sink, and thus irrelevant for calculating the maximum flow into the sink.)\n\nNow, let's identify all directed paths from Node 0 to Node 3 using only relevant forward edges:\n\n**Path 1: 0 → 2 → 3**\n*   Edge (0, 2) has a capacity of 8.\n*   Edge (2, 3) has a capacity of 9.\n*   The capacity of this path is limited by the minimum capacity of its edges: min(8, 9) = 8.\n\n**Are there any other paths from Node 0 to Node 3?**\n\nLet's consider paths starting with Node 0 and going through Node 1:\n*   **Path starting 0 → 1:**\n    *   From Node 1, there are no outgoing edges (edges with arrows pointing away from Node 1) that lead to Node 3. Node 1 only has incoming edges from Node 0, Node 2, and Node 3. Since there are no outgoing edges from Node 1, any flow reaching Node 1 cannot proceed further towards the sink (Node 3). Therefore, any path segment like 0 → 1 cannot contribute to the flow from source to sink.\n\nLet's consider paths starting with Node 0 and going through Node 2, then to Node 1:\n*   **Path starting 0 → 2 → 1:**\n    *   As established above, from Node 1, there are no outgoing edges that lead to Node 3. So, a path like 0 → 2 → 1 cannot reach the sink Node 3.\n\n**Conclusion on Paths:**\nBased on the analysis of the directed edges, the only possible path from the source (Node 0) to the sink (Node 3) is **0 → 2 → 3**.\n\n**Calculate Maximum Flow:**\nSince there is only one path, the maximum flow is simply the capacity of that path.\n*   Capacity of path 0 → 2 → 3 = min(Capacity(0,2), Capacity(2,3)) = min(8, 9) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow that can be achieved from the source (Node 0) to the sink (Node 3) is 8.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$",

The edges crossing this cut are (0,4), (0,1), and (0,3), with total capacity 9 + 4 + 3 = 16.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{16}$",

Identify Source and Sink:**\n*   Source (S): Node 0 (red)\n*   Sink (T): Node 4 (blue)\n\n**2. List Edges and their Capacities:**\nThe network has the following directed edges with their corresponding capacities:\n*   (0, 1): 6\n*   (0, 2): 6\n*   (0, 3): 1\n*   (0, 4): 7\n*   (1, 4): 6\n*   (2, 1): 5\n*   (2, 4): 9\n*   (3, 1): 3\n*   (3, 2): 2\n*   (3, 4): 7\n\n**3.

Check for More Augmenting Paths:**\nAt this point, all direct outgoing edges from the source node 0 have zero residual capacity (0,1: 0, 0,2: 0, 0,3: 0, 0,4: 0). This means no further flow can be sent directly from the source or by simple forward paths. A BFS from the source in the current residual graph would not be able to reach the sink, as there are no available outgoing edges from node 0.\nThis indicates that no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n**6. Maximum Flow and Flow Decomposition:**\nThe total maximum flow achieved is **20**.\n\nThe flow can be decomposed into the following paths in the original graph:\n*   **Path 1:** 0 → 4, carrying 7 units of flow.\n*   **Path 2:** 0 → 1 → 4, carrying 6 units of flow.\n*   **Path 3:** 0 → 2 → 4, carrying 6 units of flow.\n*   **Path 4:** 0 → 3 → 4, carrying 1 unit of flow.\n\nSum of flows = 7 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 20.\n\n**Verification (Min-Cut):**\nThe final state of the residual graph shows that nodes reachable from the source (S) with positive residual capacity only include S itself. Thus, the minimum S-T cut separates S = {0} from T = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nThe capacity of this cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T in the original graph:\nC(0,1) + C(0,2) + C(0,3) + C(0,4) = 6 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 20.\nSince the maximum flow equals the capacity of the minimum cut, our result is confirmed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{20}$",

This is confirmed by the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem. One min-cut separating the source (0) from the sink (4) is S = {0, 1, 2, 3} and T = {4}. The edges crossing this cut from S to T are (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4). Their capacities sum up to 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{12}$",

The set of nodes reachable from the source in the residual graph after the algorithm terminates is S = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and the set of unreachable nodes is T = {4}. The cut edges from S to T are (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4). Their original capacities are C(1,4)=3, C(2,4)=2, C(3,4)=1. The sum of these capacities is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. This confirms the maximum flow value.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

However, `C_res(1,3)` is 0, meaning no forward capacity. A backward edge `(3,1)` would only allow flow from 3 to 1 to reduce current flow on `(1,3)`, not increase flow from source to sink.\n\nSince all paths from Node 0 to Node 3 are blocked in the residual graph (either by saturated forward edges or lack of viable backward edges leading to the sink), no more flow can be added.\n\n**5. Max Flow Result:**\n\nThe total maximum flow achieved is 9. This is also consistent with the Min-Cut Max-Flow Theorem. Consider the cut `({0, 1, 2}, {3})`. The edges crossing this cut from the source side `S = {0, 1, 2}` to the sink side `T = {3}` are:\n*   (0,3) with capacity 2\n*   (1,3) with capacity 5\n*   (2,3) with capacity 2\n\nThe capacity of this cut is `2 + 5 + 2 = 9`. All these edges are saturated by the flow we found (`f(0,3)=2, f(1,3)=5, f(2,3)=2`). Since the total flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut, 9 is indeed the maximum flow.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{9}$",

We can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm implicitly or the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem.\n\nLet's apply the Ford-Fulkerson idea by adding flow greedily:\n\n*   **Step 1: Augment flow along Path 1 (0 → 2).**\n    *   Send 5 units of flow.\n    *   Current Total Flow = 5.\n    *   Remaining capacity on edge (0, 2) becomes 5 - 5 = 0.\n\n*   **Step 2: Augment flow along Path 2 (0 → 1 → 2).**\n    *   The capacities on this path are (0,1) = 8 and (1,2) = 6.\n    *   Send 6 units of flow.\n    *   Current Total Flow = 5 (from Step 1) + 6 (from Step 2) = 11.\n    *   Remaining capacity on edge (0, 1) becomes 8 - 6 = 2.\n    *   Remaining capacity on edge (1, 2) becomes 6 - 6 = 0.\n\n*   **Step 3: Check for more augmenting paths.**\n    *   Path 0 → 2 is blocked because edge (0, 2) has 0 remaining capacity.\n    *   Path 0 → 1 → 2 is blocked because edge (1, 2) has 0 remaining capacity.\n    *   No other paths exist from 0 to 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow is the sum of flows sent through these two paths.\n\nMaximum Flow = Flow on Path 1 + Flow on Path 2\nMaximum Flow = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n**Verification using Min-Cut (Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem):**\nThe maximum flow equals the minimum capacity of an S-T cut. An S-T cut is a partition of vertices into two sets (S, T) such that the source S is in S and the sink T is in T. The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from S to T.\n\n*   **Cut 1:** S = {0}, T = {1, 2}\n    *   Edges crossing: (0, 1) and (0, 2)\n    *   Capacity of Cut 1 = C(0, 1) + C(0, 2) = 8 + 5 = 13.\n\n*   **Cut 2:** S = {0, 1}, T = {2}\n    *   Edges crossing: (0, 2) and (1, 2)\n    *   Capacity of Cut 2 = C(0, 2) + C(1, 2) = 5 + 6 = 11.\n\nThe minimum cut capacity is 11, which matches the calculated maximum flow.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11}$",

Identify the Source and Sink:**\n*   Source: Node 0 (red)\n*   Sink: Node 2 (blue)\n\n**2. List all possible paths from Source to Sink and their capacities:**\nThere are two distinct paths from Node 0 to Node 2:\n\n*   **Path 1: 0 → 1 → 2**\n    *   Edge (0, 1) has a capacity of 3.\n    *   Edge (1, 2) has a capacity of 4.\n    *   The bottleneck capacity for this path is the minimum of its edge capacities: min(3, 4) = 3.\n\n*   **Path 2: 0 → 2**\n    *   Edge (0, 2) has a capacity of 6.\n    *   The bottleneck capacity for this path is 6.\n\n**3. Determine Maximum Flow using Augmenting Paths (Ford-Fulkerson approach):**\n\n*   **Step 1: Augment flow along Path 1 (0 → 1 → 2).**\n    *   The bottleneck capacity is 3.\n    *   Send 3 units of flow along this path.\n    *   Update residual capacities:\n        *   Capacity of (0, 1) becomes 3 - 3 = 0.\n        *   Capacity of (1, 2) becomes 4 - 3 = 1.\n    *   Current total flow = 3.\n\n*   **Step 2: Augment flow along Path 2 (0 → 2).**\n    *   The current capacity of (0, 2) is 6.\n    *   Send 6 units of flow along this path.\n    *   Update residual capacities:\n        *   Capacity of (0, 2) becomes 6 - 6 = 0.\n    *   Current total flow = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\n*   **Step 3: Check for more augmenting paths.**\n    *   All outgoing edges from the source (0) – (0,1) and (0,2) – now have 0 remaining capacity. This means no more flow can be pushed from the source to the sink.\n\n**4. Verify with Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem:**\nThe Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem states that the maximum flow in a network is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut. A cut (S, T) partitions the nodes into two sets, S (containing the source) and T (containing the sink). The capacity of a cut is the sum of capacities of edges going from a node in S to a node in T.\n\n*   **Cut 1: S = {0}, T = {1, 2}**\n    *   Edges crossing the cut from S to T: (0, 1) and (0, 2).\n    *   Capacity of Cut 1 = Capacity(0, 1) + Capacity(0, 2) = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\n*   **Cut 2: S = {0, 1}, T = {2}**\n    *   Edges crossing the cut from S to T: (0, 2) and (1, 2).\n    *   Capacity of Cut 2 = Capacity(0, 2) + Capacity(1, 2) = 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nThe minimum cut capacity is 9. This confirms that the maximum flow is 9.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe maximum flow from the source (0) to the sink (2) is 9.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{9}$",

No more flow can come directly from node 3 to node 4.\n    *   (1, 4): Remaining capacity is 0 (saturated).

Consider a cut that separates the source and sink. A minimal s-t cut is formed by partitioning the nodes into S' = {0, 1, 2, 3} and T' = {4}.
