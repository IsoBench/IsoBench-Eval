Let's verify adjacency preservation:\n*   **Edge in G:** The edge (8, 10) in G maps to $(f(8), f(10)) = (7, 9)$ in H. The edge (7, 9) exists in H. (Preserved)\n*   **Non-edges in G:** Any pair of vertices not connected in G are either two isolated vertices, or an isolated vertex and one of the connected vertices (8 or 10).\n    *   If $u, v$ are two isolated vertices in G, their images $f(u), f(v)$ are two distinct isolated vertices in H, and thus not connected. (Preserved)\n    *   If $u$ is an isolated vertex and $v \\in \\{8, 10\\}$ in G, then $(u,v)$ is not an edge. Their images $f(u)$ (an isolated vertex in H) and $f(v) \\in \\{7, 9\\}$ (a connected vertex in H) will also not be connected. (Preserved)\n\nSince a bijective mapping exists that preserves all adjacency relationships, the graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

For instance, consider the unique degree-3 vertex in each graph:\n\n*   In Graph G, `v5` has degree 3. Its neighbors are `v0` (degree 1), `v6` (degree 2), and `v8` (degree 1). The multiset of degrees of its neighbors is `{1, 1, 2}`.\n*   In Graph H, `h5` has degree 3. Its neighbors are `h0` (degree 2), `h3` (degree 2), and `h8` (degree 2). The multiset of degrees of its neighbors is `{2, 2, 2}`.\n\nSince the multisets of degrees of neighbors for the highest-degree vertex are different (`{1,1,2}` vs. `{2,2,2}`), this is another independent confirmation that the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No}$",

      "model_response": "To determine if two graphs G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a bijection (one-to-one and onto mapping) between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency. We can systematically compare their graph invariants.\n\n**1. Basic Properties (Necessary Conditions):**\n\n*   **Number of Vertices (N):**\n    *   Graph G has 15 rows/columns, so $N_G = 15$.\n    *   Graph H has 15 rows/columns, so $N_H = 15$.\n    *   The number of vertices is the same.\n\n*   **Nature of Graphs (Undirected vs. Directed):**\n    We need to check if the adjacency matrices are symmetric.\n    *   For Graph G: Let's pick a few non-zero entries: `G[0][12]=1` and `G[12][0]=1`. `G[2][5]=1` and `G[5][2]=1`. `G[4][5]=1` and `G[5][4]=1`. All non-zero entries in G appear to be symmetric. Thus, G is an undirected graph.\n    *   For Graph H: `H[0][1]=1` and `H[1][0]=1`. `H[4][11]=1` and `H[11][4]=1`. `H[7][14]=1` and `H[14][7]=1`. All non-zero entries in H also appear to be symmetric. Thus, H is an undirected graph.\n\n*   **Number of Edges (M):**\n    For an undirected graph, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees of all vertices.\n\n    *   **Graph G Degrees:**\n        Let's list the degrees of each vertex in G by summing the 1s in each row (or column):\n        deg(0) = 3 (connected to 12, 13, 14)\n        deg(1) = 1 (connected to 11)\n        deg(2) = 1 (connected to 5)\n        deg(3) = 1 (connected to 6)\n        deg(4) = 1 (connected to 5)\n        deg(5) = 2 (connected to 2, 4)\n        deg(6) = 1 (connected to 3)\n        deg(7) = 0\n        deg(8) = 0\n        deg(9) = 0\n        deg(10) = 0\n        deg(11) = 1 (connected to 1)\n        deg(12) = 2 (connected to 0, 13)\n        deg(13) = 2 (connected to 0, 12)\n        deg(14) = 1 (connected to 0)\n        Sum of degrees = 3+1+1+1+1+2+1+0+0+0+0+1+2+2+1 = 17.\n        This sum is odd, which is impossible for a simple undirected graph by the handshaking lemma. Let me re-verify the matrix entries and my sums very carefully.\n\n        Re-check G edges (count pairs of (i,j) where i<j and A[i][j]=1):\n        (0,12), (0,13), (0,14) - 3 edges\n        (1,11) - 1 edge\n        (2,5) - 1 edge\n        (3,6) - 1 edge\n        (4,5) - 1 edge\n        (12,13) - 1 edge\n        Total unique edges $M_G = 3+1+1+1+1+1 = 8$.\n        Okay, the manual degree sum was off previously. Let's recalculate degrees based on these 8 edges for G:\n        deg(0) = 3 (12,13,14)\n        deg(1) = 1 (11)\n        deg(2) = 1 (5)\n        deg(3) = 1 (6)\n        deg(4) = 1 (5)\n        deg(5) = 2 (2,4)\n        deg(6) = 1 (3)\n        deg(7) = 0\n        deg(8) = 0\n        deg(9) = 0\n        deg(10) = 0\n        deg(11) = 1 (1)\n        deg(12) = 2 (0,13)\n        deg(13) = 2 (0,12)\n        deg(14) = 1 (0)\n        Sum of degrees = 3+1+1+1+1+2+1+0+0+0+0+1+2+2+1 = 17.\n        The sum is still 17. This indicates an inherent issue with the provided matrix G, as an undirected graph must have an even sum of degrees.\n\n        **Critical finding:** If the input graph matrices are strictly taken as given, and they are not perfectly symmetric for *all* implied edges (i.e. if A[i][j]=1 implies (i,j) is an edge, and we expect A[j][i]=1 for undirected), then the problem cannot proceed as an undirected graph isomorphism problem. However, the problem statement says \"Graph G adjacency matrix\" implying an undirected graph and the 1s are indeed symmetric in pairs. The only way the sum of degrees can be odd is if one of the '1' entries is a self-loop (on the diagonal) or if there's a typo. There are no self-loops (A[i][i]=0). Let me re-sum the first provided matrix for G carefully one last time.\n\n        Let's list G matrix's 1s with their symmetric partners:\n        (0,12), (12,0)\n        (0,13), (13,0)\n        (0,14), (14,0)\n        (1,11), (11,1)\n        (2,5), (5,2)\n        (3,6), (6,3)\n        (4,5), (5,4)\n        (12,13), (13,12)\n        These are 8 distinct edges. For example, edge (0,12) means deg(0) gets +1 and deg(12) gets +1.\n        So sum of degrees must be 2 * number of edges = 2 * 8 = 16.\n        The sum I keep getting (17) must be a calculation error on my part during manual sum.\n        Let's sum degrees again:\n        3 (v0)\n        1 (v1)\n        1 (v2)\n        1 (v3)\n        1 (v4)\n        2 (v5)\n        1 (v6)\n        0 (v7)\n        0 (v8)\n        0 (v9)\n        0 (v10)\n        1 (v11)\n        2 (v12)\n        2 (v13)\n        1 (v14)\n        Sum = 3+1+1+1+1+2+1+0+0+0+0+1+2+2+1 = 17.\n        This is incredibly frustrating. Let's list the degree computation for each node directly from the matrix.\n        Row sums (out-degrees):\n        [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1] - Sum is 17.\n        Column sums (in-degrees):\n        Col 0: G[12][0]+G[13][0]+G[14][0] = 1+1+1 = 3\n        Col 1: G[11][1] = 1\n        Col 2: G[5][2] = 1\n        Col 3: G[6][3] = 1\n        Col 4: G[5][4] = 1\n        Col 5: G[2][5]+G[4][5] = 1+1 = 2\n        Col 6: G[3][6] = 1\n        Col 7: 0\n        Col 8: 0\n        Col 9: 0\n        Col 10: 0\n        Col 11: G[1][11] = 1\n        Col 12: G[0][12]+G[13][12] = 1+1 = 2\n        Col 13: G[0][13]+G[12][13] = 1+1 = 2\n        Col 14: G[0][14] = 1\n        Column sums = [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1] - Sum is 17.\n        The row sums and column sums match for G, and they are symmetric. So, my degree list is correct for G.\n        This means the given matrix for G *is* an undirected graph, but it contains an error if it's meant to be a simple graph (where sum of degrees must be even). The sum of degrees being 17 means there's an odd number of vertices with odd degrees.\n        Nodes with odd degrees in G: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 14}. There are 8 nodes with odd degrees. This is consistent with sum of degrees being even! Ah, the \"number of nodes with odd degrees must be even\" is the rule. And indeed it is 8. The problem must be my calculation of 2*M. Sum of degrees is always even. My summation must be flawed.\n\n        Let's try summing G's 1s directly from the matrix, including both A[i][j] and A[j][i].\n        Row 0: 3 ones\n        Row 1: 1 one\n        Row 2: 1 one\n        Row 3: 1 one\n        Row 4: 1 one\n        Row 5: 2 ones\n        Row 6: 1 one\n        Row 7: 0\n        Row 8: 0\n        Row 9: 0\n        Row 10: 0\n        Row 11: 1 one\n        Row 12: 2 ones\n        Row 13: 2 ones\n        Row 14: 1 one\n        Total sum of 1s in matrix = 3+1+1+1+1+2+1+0+0+0+0+1+2+2+1 = 17.\n        This sum represents the sum of degrees (total number of connections). So Sum(degrees) = 17.\n        This IS the issue. An undirected graph must have an even sum of degrees. This implies there is a typo in the matrix for Graph G provided.\n        Let's assume there's a typo in G and it should have an even degree sum.\n        If I count the distinct edges (i<j where G[i][j]=1), I get 8 edges. $M_G = 8$.\n        So the correct sum of degrees for G *should* be 2 * 8 = 16.\n        My current summed degrees for G: [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This sum is 17.\n        One entry must be wrong. Let's re-verify from input.\n        G[0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] (deg 3) - OK\n        G[1] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        G[2] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        G[3] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        G[4] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        G[5] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 2) - OK\n        G[6] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        G[7] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 0) - OK\n        G[8] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 0) - OK\n        G[9] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 0) - OK\n        G[10] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 0) - OK\n        G[11] = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        G[12] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] (deg 2) - OK\n        G[13] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] (deg 2) - OK\n        G[14] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (deg 1) - OK\n        The calculation is correct. The sum of degrees for G IS 17, and the matrix is symmetric, and there are no self-loops. This means the graph G, as provided by the matrix, is not a valid simple undirected graph according to standard graph theory (sum of degrees must be even).\n\n        If the problem implies \"treat these as adjacency lists for directed graphs where A[i][j]=1 means i->j\", then we would proceed with directed graph isomorphism. But \"structurally identical\" usually implies undirected.\n\n        **Assumption:** Given the phrasing \"determine whether two graphs are isomorphic\", and the fact that matrices are almost symmetric, it's highly probable that the intent was undirected graphs and there is a single typo in the matrix for G. The sum of degrees for H will be calculated now. If H's sum of degrees is even, and G's is odd, then they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n    *   **Graph H Degrees:**\n        deg(0) = 1 (to 1)\n        deg(1) = 2 (to 0, 9)\n        deg(2) = 1 (to 13)\n        deg(3) = 1 (to 12)\n        deg(4) = 2 (to 11, 14)\n        deg(5) = 0\n        deg(6) = 0\n        deg(7) = 1 (to 14)\n        deg(8) = 0\n        deg(9) = 1 (to 1)\n        deg(10) = 0\n        deg(11) = 2 (to 4, 14)\n        deg(12) = 1 (to 3)\n        deg(13) = 1 (to 2)\n        deg(14) = 3 (to 4, 7, 11)\n        Sum of degrees for H = 1+2+1+1+2+0+0+1+0+1+0+2+1+1+3 = 16.\n        Number of edges $M_H = 16 / 2 = 8$.\n\n        Since $M_G$ (calculated by summing distinct edges) is 8, and $M_H$ is 8. This is consistent.\n        The discrepancy in the sum of degrees for G is puzzling. If we *assume* M_G = 8 from unique edges, then the degree list provided for G (and confirmed via row/column sums) must have a single error of +/-1.\n        Let's assume the number of edges ($M_G=8$, $M_H=8$) is the primary invariant for size. Then they pass this first test.\n\n**2. Degree Sequences (Invariant):**\n*   **Graph G Degree Sequence (from above):**\n    [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n    Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3] (4 zeros, 7 ones, 3 twos, 1 three)\n\n*   **Graph H Degree Sequence (from above):**\n    [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n    Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3] (4 zeros, 7 ones, 3 twos, 1 three)\n\nThe sorted degree sequences are identical.

Constructing an Isomorphism Mapping:**\nLet $f: V_G \\to V_H$ be the bijection.\n\n*   **Isolated nodes (deg 0):**\n    $f(7_G) = 5_H$\n    $f(8_G) = 6_H$\n    $f(9_G) = 8_H$\n    $f(10_G) = 10_H$\n\n*   **P2 components (deg 1-1):**\n    From G: {1,11} and {3,6}\n    From H: {2,13} and {3,12}\n    $f(1_G) = 2_H$ (maps deg 1 to deg 1)\n    $f(11_G) = 13_H$ (maps deg 1 to deg 1, connected to $f(1_G)$)\n    $f(3_G) = 3_H$ (maps deg 1 to deg 1)\n    $f(6_G) = 12_H$ (maps deg 1 to deg 1, connected to $f(3_G)$)\n\n*   **P3 components (deg 1-2-1):**\n    From G: {2,4,5} where 5 is center (deg 2).\n    From H: {0,1,9} where 1 is center (deg 2).\n    $f(5_G) = 1_H$ (maps deg 2 center to deg 2 center)\n    $f(2_G) = 0_H$ (maps deg 1 leaf to deg 1 leaf, connected to center)\n    $f(4_G) = 9_H$ (maps deg 1 leaf to deg 1 leaf, connected to center)\n\n*   **Diamond components (deg 1-2-2-3):**\n    From G: {0,12,13,14} with degrees (deg(0)=3, deg(12)=2, deg(13)=2, deg(14)=1).\n    From H: {4,7,11,14} with degrees (deg(4)=2, deg(7)=1, deg(11)=2, deg(14)=3).\n    Map highest degree to highest degree: $f(0_G) = 14_H$ (deg 3 to deg 3)\n    Map lowest degree to lowest degree: $f(14_G) = 7_H$ (deg 1 to deg 1)\n    Map remaining degree 2 nodes:\n    $f(12_G) = 4_H$ (deg 2 to deg 2)\n    $f(13_G) = 11_H$ (deg 2 to deg 2)\n\n    **Verify Adjacencies for Diamond Components:**\n    *   Edge (0,12) in G maps to ($f(0_G)$, $f(12_G)$) = (14,4) in H. (H[14][4]=1, Yes)\n    *   Edge (0,13) in G maps to ($f(0_G)$, $f(13_G)$) = (14,11) in H. (H[14][11]=1, Yes)\n    *   Edge (0,14) in G maps to ($f(0_G)$, $f(14_G)$) = (14,7) in H. (H[14][7]=1, Yes)\n    *   Edge (12,13) in G maps to ($f(12_G)$, $f(13_G)$) = (4,11) in H. (H[4][11]=1, Yes)\n    All adjacencies within this component are preserved.\n\nThe mapping covers all vertices and preserves all adjacency relationships. Despite the initial confusion about the degree sum for G, the structural invariants (number of nodes, edges, degree sequence, and component structure) match perfectly, and a valid isomorphism can be constructed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the matching graph invariants (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence, and the isomorphic structure of connected components) and the successful construction of a vertex bijection that preserves adjacency, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe final mapping is:\n$f(0_G) = 14_H$\n$f(1_G) = 2_H$\n$f(2_G) = 0_H$\n$f(3_G) = 3_H$\n$f(4_G) = 9_H$\n$f(5_G) = 1_H$\n$f(6_G) = 12_H$\n$f(7_G) = 5_H$\n$f(8_G) = 6_H$\n$f(9_G) = 8_H$\n$f(10_G) = 10_H$\n$f(11_G) = 13_H$\n$f(12_G) = 4_H$\n$f(13_G) = 11_H$\n$f(14_G) = 7_H$\n\nThe graphs G and H are **isomorphic**.",

Connected Components / Structural Analysis:**\n*   **Graph G:**\n    *   It has one connected component consisting of nodes {0, 1, 9}. The edges are (0,1) and (1,9). This forms a path of length 2 (P3 graph), where node 1 is the central node connected to nodes 0 and 9.\n    *   The remaining 11 nodes ({2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13}) are isolated (degree 0).\n\n*   **Graph H:**\n    *   It has one connected component consisting of nodes {2, 10, 13}. The edges are (2,10) and (2,13). This also forms a path of length 2 (P3 graph), where node 2 is the central node connected to nodes 10 and 13.\n    *   The remaining 11 nodes ({0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12}) are isolated (degree 0).\n\nBoth graphs consist of one P3 component and 11 isolated vertices. This indicates strong structural similarity.\n\n**5. Constructing an Isomorphism (Bijection):**\nWe can define a mapping $\\phi: V(G) \\to V(H)$ that preserves adjacency.\n\n1.  **Map the P3 components:**\n    *   The node with degree 2 in G is node 1. The node with degree 2 in H is node 2.\n        *   Let $\\phi(1) = 2$.\n    *   The nodes with degree 1 in G are nodes 0 and 9. The nodes with degree 1 in H are nodes 10 and 13. We can map them in any consistent way.\n        *   Let $\\phi(0) = 10$.\n        *   Let $\\phi(9) = 13$.\n\n    Let's verify these mappings for edges:\n    *   Edge (0,1) in G: Does $(\\phi(0), \\phi(1)) = (10,2)$ exist in H? Yes, H[10][2]=1.\n    *   Edge (1,9) in G: Does $(\\phi(1), \\phi(9)) = (2,13)$ exist in H? Yes, H[2][13]=1.\n\n2.  **Map the isolated vertices:**\n    The isolated vertices in G are $V_G^{iso} = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13\\}$.\n    The isolated vertices in H are $V_H^{iso} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\\}$.\n    Since all these nodes have degree 0, any one-to-one mapping between $V_G^{iso}$ and $V_H^{iso}$ will preserve their non-adjacency properties. For instance, we can map them in increasing order:\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 0$\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(4) = 3$\n    *   $\\phi(5) = 4$\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 5$\n    *   $\\phi(7) = 6$\n    *   $\\phi(8) = 7$\n    *   $\\phi(10) = 8$\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 9$\n    *   $\\phi(12) = 11$\n    *   $\\phi(13) = 12$\n\nThis completes the bijection. All properties match, and a valid mapping exists.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the structural composition of their connected components (one P3 and 11 isolated vertices), Graph G and Graph H are **isomorphic**.",

So, N_G = 9.\n\n2.  **Degrees of Vertices (deg_G):** Summing the entries in each row (or column for undirected graphs, or both for directed, but here it's symmetric so just rows are fine):\n    *   deg(0) = 1 (connected to 8)\n    *   deg(1) = 0\n    *   deg(2) = 2 (connected to 4, 6)\n    *   deg(3) = 1 (connected to 4)\n    *   deg(4) = 2 (connected to 2, 3)\n    *   deg(5) = 1 (connected to 6)\n    *   deg(6) = 3 (connected to 2, 5, 7)\n    *   deg(7) = 1 (connected to 6)\n    *   deg(8) = 1 (connected to 0)\n\n3.  **Degree Sequence of G:** [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3] (sorted)\n\n4.  **Number of Edges (M_G):** The sum of degrees is 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12. For an undirected graph, M = (Sum of Degrees) / 2. So, M_G = 12 / 2 = 6.\n\n**Graph H Analysis:**\n\nAdjacency Matrix H:\n```\n[[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 0\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 1\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  // Node 2\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 3\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 4\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 5\n [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 6\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Node 7\n [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] // Node 8\n```\n\n1.  **Number of Vertices (N_H):** Counting the rows (or columns), we have 9 vertices (0 to 8). So, N_H = 9.\n\n2.  **Degrees of Vertices (deg_H):**\n    *   deg(0) = 1 (connected to 1)\n    *   deg(1) = 2 (connected to 0, 4)\n    *   deg(2) = 2 (connected to 6, 8)\n    *   deg(3) = 1 (connected to 5)\n    *   deg(4) = 2 (connected to 1, 5)\n    *   deg(5) = 2 (connected to 3, 4)\n    *   deg(6) = 1 (connected to 2)\n    *   deg(7) = 0\n    *   deg(8) = 1 (connected to 2)\n\n3.  **Degree Sequence of H:** [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] (sorted)\n\n4.  **Number of Edges (M_H):** The sum of degrees is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 12. So, M_H = 12 / 2 = 6.\n\n**Comparison of Invariants:**\n\n*   **Number of Vertices:** N_G = 9, N_H = 9. (Match)\n*   **Number of Edges:** M_G = 6, M_H = 6. (Match)\n*   **Degree Sequences:**\n    *   Graph G: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n    *   Graph H: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nThe degree sequences do **not match**. Graph G has one vertex with degree 3 (node 6), while Graph H has no vertex with degree 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the degree sequences of Graph G and Graph H are different, they cannot be isomorphic. A graph isomorphism requires a bijection between vertices that preserves adjacency, which implies that corresponding vertices must have the same degree. The presence of a degree-3 vertex in G and its absence in H means no such bijection can exist.\n\nTherefore, Graph G and Graph H are **not isomorphic**.",

Since we matched degrees and built the map based on adjacency, it is highly likely to be correct. We can confirm by checking a few edges or all of them if desired.\n\nLet's check the first few edges of G and their mapped counterparts in H:\n*   G: (v0, v4) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v0)$, $\\phi(v4)$) = (u6, u0). Is H[6][0] = 1? Yes.\n*   G: (v0, v6) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v0)$, $\\phi(v6)$) = (u6, u10). Is H[6][10] = 1? Yes.\n*   G: (v0, v9) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v0)$, $\\phi(v9)$) = (u6, u13). Is H[6][13] = 1? Yes.\n\n*   G: (v1, v12) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v1)$, $\\phi(v12)$) = (u2, u3). Is H[2][3] = 1? Yes.\n*   G: (v1, v13) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v1)$, $\\phi(v13)$) = (u2, u8). Is H[2][8] = 1? Yes.\n\n*   G: (v2, v9) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v2)$, $\\phi(v9)$) = (u5, u13). Is H[5][13] = 1? Yes.\n\n*   G: (v3, x) (no edges) $\\rightarrow$ H: ($\\phi(v3)$, x) = (u9, x) (no edges). Consistent.\n\nAll checks made during the construction of the map, and these additional checks, confirm that the adjacency is preserved. Since the number of vertices and edges are identical, this one-to-one and onto mapping is indeed an isomorphism.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graphs G and H are **isomorphic**.",

This is a strong indicator that they *might* be isomorphic.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Connected Components and Structure\n\nLet's break down the structure of each graph based on its edges:\n\n*   **Structure of Graph G:**\n    1.  **Component 1 (P2):** Vertices 3 and 4 form a connected component with a single edge (3,4). Both nodes have degree 1.\n    2.  **Component 2 (P3 or Star Graph K1,2):** Vertices 5, 6, and 10 form a connected component. Vertex 5 is connected to both 6 and 10. Vertex 5 has degree 2, while vertices 6 and 10 have degree 1. This forms a path graph P3 (6-5-10).\n    3.  **Component 3 (Isolated Vertices):** Vertices 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 are isolated, each having degree 0. There are 6 such vertices.\n\n*   **Structure of Graph H:**\n    1.  **Component 1 (P2):** Vertices 0 and 3 form a connected component with a single edge (0,3). Both nodes have degree 1.\n    2.  **Component 2 (P3 or Star Graph K1,2):** Vertices 6, 7, and 8 form a connected component. Vertex 6 is connected to both 7 and 8. Vertex 6 has degree 2, while vertices 7 and 8 have degree 1. This forms a path graph P3 (7-6-8).\n    3.  **Component 3 (Isolated Vertices):** Vertices 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10 are isolated, each having degree 0. There are 6 such vertices.\n\nBoth graphs consist of the same number and types of connected components: one P2, one P3, and six isolated vertices. This strongly suggests isomorphism.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Construct a Bijection (Isomorphism Mapping)\n\nBased on the structural similarities, we can propose a mapping $f: V_G \\to V_H$:\n\n1.  **Map the P2 components:**\n    *   In G: (3, 4)\n    *   In H: (0, 3)\n    Let's map:\n    *   `f(3) = 0`\n    *   `f(4) = 3`\n    (We could also map f(3)=3 and f(4)=0, the choice doesn't impact isomorphism)\n\n2.  **Map the P3 components (K1,2 stars):**\n    *   In G: Central node is 5 (degree 2); leaves are 6, 10 (degree 1).\n    *   In H: Central node is 6 (degree 2); leaves are 7, 8 (degree 1).\n    We must map the central nodes to each other, and the leaf nodes to each other.\n    Let's map:\n    *   `f(5) = 6` (central node of G to central node of H)\n    *   `f(6) = 7` (one leaf of G to one leaf of H)\n    *   `f(10) = 8` (the other leaf of G to the other leaf of H)\n    (The mapping of (6,10) to (7,8) can be swapped, e.g., f(6)=8, f(10)=7)\n\n3.  **Map the Isolated Vertices:**\n    *   Isolated in G: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}\n    *   Isolated in H: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10}\n    These can be mapped arbitrarily as long as it's a bijection:\n    *   `f(0) = 1`\n    *   `f(1) = 2`\n    *   `f(2) = 4`\n    *   `f(7) = 5`\n    *   `f(8) = 9`\n    *   `f(9) = 10`\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Mapping Preserves Adjacency\n\nWe need to check that for every edge (u, v) in G, (f(u), f(v)) is an edge in H, and for every non-edge (u, v) in G, (f(u), f(v)) is a non-edge in H. Since we've matched degrees and components, and the number of edges is the same, checking edges is sufficient.\n\n*   **Edge (3, 4) in G:**\n    *   `f(3) = 0`, `f(4) = 3`.\n    *   Is (0, 3) an edge in H? Yes (H_adj[0][3] = 1). **MATCH**\n\n*   **Edge (5, 6) in G:**\n    *   `f(5) = 6`, `f(6) = 7`.\n    *   Is (6, 7) an edge in H? Yes (H_adj[6][7] = 1). **MATCH**\n\n*   **Edge (5, 10) in G:**\n    *   `f(5) = 6`, `f(10) = 8`.\n    *   Is (6, 8) an edge in H? Yes (H_adj[6][8] = 1). **MATCH**\n\nAll edges in Graph G are preserved under this mapping in Graph H. Since the total number of edges is the same, and the mapping is a bijection, non-edges are also preserved.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the consistent properties (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and connected component structures) and the successful construction of a bijection that preserves adjacency, we can conclude that Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

Neighbor degrees: [1, 2]\n    *   G[3]: Neighbors G[4] (deg 1), G[5] (deg 1). Neighbor degrees: [1, 1]\n    *   G[6]: Neighbors G[2] (deg 1), G[8] (deg 1). Neighbor degrees: [1, 1]\n    *   G[9]: Neighbors G[0] (deg 2), G[1] (deg 1). Neighbor degrees: [2, 1]\n\n    *   Summary for G: Two nodes (G[3], G[6]) have neighbors with degrees [1, 1]. Two nodes (G[0], G[9]) have neighbors with degrees [1, 2].

A common first step is to compare graph invariants, such as the number of vertices, number of edges, and the degree sequence.\n\n**1. Number of Vertices:**\nBoth Graph G and Graph H are represented by 8x8 adjacency matrices, meaning they both have 8 vertices.\n*   Number of vertices (N) for G = 8\n*   Number of vertices (N) for H = 8\nThis condition is met.\n\n**2.

We already mapped $\\phi(11)=0$.\n    *   The other neighbor of $\\phi(6)=5$ in H is 8 (deg 1).\n    *   So, $\\phi(3) = 8$.\n\n5.  **Map the isolated vertices:**\n    *   The 7 isolated vertices in G are {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n    *   The 7 isolated vertices in H are {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11}.\n    *   Any one-to-one mapping between these sets will work. For example:\n        *   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n        *   $\\phi(4) = 3$\n        *   $\\phi(5) = 4$\n        *   $\\phi(7) = 6$\n        *   $\\phi(8) = 7$\n        *   $\\phi(9) = 10$\n        *   $\\phi(10) = 11$\n\n**Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\n\nWe check if $(u, v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(\\phi(u), \\phi(v))$ is an edge in H.\n\n*   **Edge (0, 11) in G:**\n    *   $\\phi(0) = 2$\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 0$\n    *   Is (2, 0) an edge in H? Yes, H[2][0] = 1 (and H[0][2]=1). (Matches)\n\n*   **Edge (1, 11) in G:**\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 9$\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 0$\n    *   Is (9, 0) an edge in H? Yes, H[9][0] = 1 (and H[0][9]=1). (Matches)\n\n*   **Edge (3, 6) in G:**\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 8$\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 5$\n    *   Is (8, 5) an edge in H? Yes, H[8][5] = 1 (and H[5][8]=1). (Matches)\n\n*   **Edge (6, 11) in G:**\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 5$\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 0$\n    *   Is (5, 0) an edge in H? Yes, H[5][0] = 1 (and H[0][5]=1). (Matches)\n\nAll edges in G map to edges in H. Since the number of edges is the same, this implies all edges in H are also covered by the inverse mapping. The mapping preserves adjacency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGraphs G and H have the same number of vertices, the same number of edges, identical degree sequences, and their non-isolated components are structurally identical (both are a path of length 2 connected to a central vertex, which also has two other leaf nodes). A bijection preserving adjacency can be constructed.\n\nTherefore, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

Furthermore, upon examining their structures:\n*   Graph G consists of a $K_{1,4}$ star graph (centered at node 6, with leaves 0, 3, 4, 7) and three isolated vertices (1, 2, 5).\n*   Graph H consists of a $K_{1,4}$ star graph (centered at node 1, with leaves 2, 3, 4, 5) and three isolated vertices (0, 6, 7).\n\nThe structural decomposition of both graphs is identical. We can define a bijection $\\phi: V(G) \\rightarrow V(H)$ that preserves adjacency:\n\n*   **Map the central nodes (degree 4):**\n    $\\phi(6) = 1$\n*   **Map the leaf nodes (degree 1):** (Any permutation works)\n    $\\phi(0) = 2$\n    $\\phi(3) = 3$\n    $\\phi(4) = 4$\n    $\\phi(7) = 5$\n*   **Map the isolated nodes (degree 0):** (Any permutation works)\n    $\\phi(1) = 0$\n    $\\phi(2) = 6$\n    $\\phi(5) = 7$\n\nLet's verify a few adjacencies with this mapping:\n*   In G, (0, 6) is an edge. In H, ($\\phi(0), \\phi(6)$) = (2, 1) is an edge. (Yes, H[2][1]=1)\n*   In G, (4, 6) is an edge. In H, ($\\phi(4), \\phi(6)$) = (4, 1) is an edge. (Yes, H[4][1]=1)\n*   In G, (1, 3) is not an edge. In H, ($\\phi(1), \\phi(3)$) = (0, 3) is not an edge. (Yes, H[0][3]=0)\n\nAll adjacencies and non-adjacencies are preserved under this mapping.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nYes, the two graphs G and H are isomorphic.",

We have verified that all edges in G are preserved as edges in H under this mapping. Since the total number of edges is the same, this also implies that non-edges are preserved as non-edges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll necessary conditions for isomorphism are met, and we have successfully constructed an explicit isomorphism mapping between the vertices of G and H that preserves adjacency. Therefore, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

The degrees within this component are deg(V1)=2, deg(V9)=1, deg(V10)=1. A $K_{1,2}$ graph is structurally identical to a $P_3$ graph.\n3.  **Connected Component 2 (V0, V8):** The edge is (V0,V8). This forms a path graph $P_2$ (or $K_2$). The degrees within this component are deg(V0)=1, deg(V8)=1.\n\n**Comparison of Connected Components:**\nBoth graphs have:\n*   7 isolated vertices.\n*   One component that is isomorphic to a $P_3$ (a path of 3 vertices / a star graph $K_{1,2}$).\n*   One component that is isomorphic to a $P_2$ (a path of 2 vertices / an edge).\n\nSince the number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and the specific structures (up to isomorphism) of their connected components are identical, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Step 3: Constructing an Isomorphism (Optional Verification)**\n\nWe can define a bijection $\\phi: V_G \\to V_H$ that preserves adjacency:\n\n1.  **Mapping of Isolated Vertices:**\n    Map the 7 isolated vertices of G to the 7 isolated vertices of H in any one-to-one manner. For example:\n    *   $\\phi(V1_G) = V2_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V2_G) = V3_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V3_G) = V4_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V7_G) = V5_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V8_G) = V6_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V9_G) = V7_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V11_G) = V11_H$\n\n2.  **Mapping of $P_2$ components:**\n    *   In G: V5-V10 (degrees 1,1)\n    *   In H: V0-V8 (degrees 1,1)\n    *   Let's map:\n        *   $\\phi(V5_G) = V0_H$\n        *   $\\phi(V10_G) = V8_H$\n    *   Check: (V5,V10) is an edge in G. Is ($\\phi(V5_G)$, $\\phi(V10_G)$) = (V0,V8) an edge in H? Yes.\n\n3.  **Mapping of $P_3$/$K_{1,2}$ components:**\n    *   In G: V0-V4-V6 (degrees 1,2,1)\n    *   In H: V9-V1-V10 (degrees 1,2,1)\n    *   Map the central node (degree 2) of G to the central node (degree 2) of H:\n        *   $\\phi(V4_G) = V1_H$\n    *   Map the leaf nodes (degree 1) of G to the leaf nodes (degree 1) of H:\n        *   $\\phi(V0_G) = V9_H$\n        *   $\\phi(V6_G) = V10_H$\n    *   Check adjacencies:\n        *   (V0,V4) is an edge in G. Is ($\\phi(V0_G)$, $\\phi(V4_G)$) = (V9,V1) an edge in H? Yes.\n        *   (V4,V6) is an edge in G. Is ($\\phi(V4_G)$, $\\phi(V6_G)$) = (V1,V10) an edge in H? Yes.\n\nThis completes a valid isomorphism mapping.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and the structure of their connected components, Graph G and Graph H are structurally identical. Therefore, they are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

      "model_response": "To determine whether two graphs G and H are isomorphic, we follow a systematic approach:\n\n1.  **Check Basic Graph Properties:**\n    *   **Number of Vertices (N):** Both adjacency matrices are 15x15, so both graphs G and H have N = 15 vertices. This is a necessary condition for isomorphism.\n    *   **Nature of the Graph (Undirected/Directed):** We examine the matrices for symmetry ($A_{ij} = A_{ji}$).\n        *   For Graph G, observe entries like G[0,14]=1 and G[14,0]=1; G[1,9]=1 and G[9,1]=1, etc. All 1s in the matrix appear to be symmetric. Thus, G is an undirected graph.\n        *   For Graph H, observe entries like H[0,7]=1 and H[7,0]=1; H[1,12]=1 and H[12,1]=1, etc. All 1s in the matrix also appear to be symmetric. Thus, H is an undirected graph.\n    *   **Number of Edges (M):** For an undirected graph, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees of all vertices.\n\n    Let's calculate the degrees for each vertex in G:\n    Deg(0)=1 (connected to 14)\n    Deg(1)=2 (connected to 9, 12)\n    Deg(2)=0\n    Deg(3)=4 (connected to 6, 8, 11, 14)\n    Deg(4)=1 (connected to 10)\n    Deg(5)=0\n    Deg(6)=4 (connected to 3, 11, 12, 13)\n    Deg(7)=1 (connected to 10)\n    Deg(8)=3 (connected to 3, 10, 14)\n    Deg(9)=1 (connected to 1)\n    Deg(10)=3 (connected to 4, 7, 8)\n    Deg(11)=2 (connected to 3, 6)\n    Deg(12)=2 (connected to 1, 6)\n    Deg(13)=1 (connected to 6)\n    Deg(14)=3 (connected to 0, 3, 8)\n    Sum of degrees for G = 1+2+0+4+1+0+4+1+3+1+3+2+2+1+3 = 28.\n    Number of edges in G (M_G) = 28 / 2 = 14.\n\n    Now, calculate the degrees for each vertex in H:\n    Deg(0)=3 (connected to 7, 9, 14)\n    Deg(1)=1 (connected to 12)\n    Deg(2)=3 (connected to 4, 13, 14)\n    Deg(3)=1 (connected to 11)\n    Deg(4)=1 (connected to 2)\n    Deg(5)=2 (connected to 11, 12)\n    Deg(6)=0\n    Deg(7)=4 (connected to 0, 10, 11, 14)\n    Deg(8)=0\n    Deg(9)=1 (connected to 0)\n    Deg(10)=2 (connected to 7, 11)\n    Deg(11)=4 (connected to 3, 5, 7, 10)\n    Deg(12)=2 (connected to 1, 5)\n    Deg(13)=1 (connected to 2)\n    Deg(14)=3 (connected to 0, 2, 7)\n    Sum of degrees for H = 3+1+3+1+1+2+0+4+0+1+2+4+2+1+3 = 28.\n    Number of edges in H (M_H) = 28 / 2 = 14.\n\n    **Result of Basic Property Check:** Both graphs G and H have 15 vertices and 14 edges. This means they *could* be isomorphic.\n\n2.  **Compare Degree Sequences:**\n    For isomorphism, the sorted degree sequences must be identical.\n    Degrees of G: [1, 2, 0, 4, 1, 0, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n    Sorted Degree Sequence of G: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n\n    Degrees of H: [3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n    Sorted Degree Sequence of H: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n\n    **Result of Degree Sequence Check:** The degree sequences are identical. This is another necessary condition met, so we must proceed further.\n\n3.  **Attempt to Construct an Isomorphism Mapping:**\n    We will try to find a bijective mapping $f: V(G) \\to V(H)$ such that for any two vertices $u, v \\in V(G)$, $(u, v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H.\n\n    Let's partition the nodes by their degrees for easier mapping:\n    **G Node Partitions:**\n    Deg 0: {2, 5}\n    Deg 1: {0, 4, 7, 9, 13}\n    Deg 2: {1, 11, 12}\n    Deg 3: {8, 10, 14}\n    Deg 4: {3, 6}\n\n    **H Node Partitions:**\n    Deg 0: {6, 8}\n    Deg 1: {1, 3, 4, 9, 13}\n    Deg 2: {5, 10, 12}\n    Deg 3: {0, 2, 14}\n    Deg 4: {7, 11}\n\n    We start by picking a node from G with a specific degree and try to map it to a node in H of the same degree. Let's start with a deg 4 node, say G_node 3. We try mapping it to H_node 7.\n\n    **Proposed Initial Mapping:** $f(3) = 7$ (both deg 4)\n\n    Now, examine their neighbors and their degrees:\n    Neighbors of G_node 3: {6, 8, 11, 14}\n    Degrees of these neighbors in G: deg(6)=4, deg(8)=3, deg(11)=2, deg(14)=3.

(Multiset: {2, 3, 3, 4})\n    The degree multisets of neighbors match, which is promising.\n\n    Based on the degrees of neighbors:\n    *   G_node 6 (deg 4) must map to H_node 11 (deg 4). So, $f(6) = 11$.\n    *   G_node 11 (deg 2) must map to H_node 10 (deg 2). So, $f(11) = 10$.\n    *   G_nodes {8, 14} (both deg 3) must map to H_nodes {0, 14} (both deg 3). Let's try $f(8) = 14$ and $f(14) = 0$. (This is the critical choice; if it fails, we'd swap them).\n\n    **Partial Mapping (Set 1):**\n    $f(3) = 7$\n    $f(6) = 11$\n    $f(11) = 10$\n    $f(8) = 14$\n    $f(14) = 0$\n\n    Let's check consistency with these mappings by looking at edges involving G_node 6 and its mapped neighbors:\n    G_node 6 neighbors: {3, 11, 12, 13}\n    Mapped H neighbors: {$f(3)=7$, $f(11)=10$, $f(12)$, $f(13)$}\n    H_node 11 neighbors: {3, 5, 7, 10}\n    Degrees of G_node 6 neighbors: deg(3)=4, deg(11)=2, deg(12)=2, deg(13)=1 (Multiset: {1, 2, 2, 4})\n    Degrees of H_node 11 neighbors: deg(3)=1, deg(5)=2, deg(7)=4, deg(10)=2 (Multiset: {1, 2, 2, 4})\n    Consistent.\n\n    From G_node 6 mapping:\n    *   G_node 12 (deg 2) must map to H_node 5 (deg 2). So, $f(12) = 5$.\n    *   G_node 13 (deg 1) must map to H_node 3 (deg 1). So, $f(13) = 3$.\n\n    **Partial Mapping (Set 2):**\n    $f(12) = 5$\n    $f(13) = 3$\n\n    Now, check G_node 12 and its mapped neighbors:\n    G_node 12 neighbors: {1, 6}\n    Mapped H neighbors: {$f(1)$, $f(6)=11$}\n    H_node 5 neighbors: {11, 12}\n    Degrees of G_node 12 neighbors: deg(1)=2, deg(6)=4\n    Degrees of H_node 5 neighbors: deg(11)=4, deg(12)=2\n    Consistent.\n\n    From G_node 12 mapping:\n    *   G_node 1 (deg 2) must map to H_node 12 (deg 2). So, $f(1) = 12$.\n\n    **Partial Mapping (Set 3):**\n    $f(1) = 12$\n\n    Now, check G_node 1 and its mapped neighbors:\n    G_node 1 neighbors: {9, 12}\n    Mapped H neighbors: {$f(9)$, $f(12)=5$}\n    H_node 12 neighbors: {1, 5}\n    Degrees of G_node 1 neighbors: deg(9)=1, deg(12)=2\n    Degrees of H_node 12 neighbors: deg(1)=1, deg(5)=2\n    Consistent.\n\n    From G_node 1 mapping:\n    *   G_node 9 (deg 1) must map to H_node 1 (deg 1). So, $f(9) = 1$.\n\n    **Partial Mapping (Set 4):**\n    $f(9) = 1$\n\n    Remaining unmapped nodes:\n    G: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10}\n    H: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13}\n\n    Degrees of remaining G nodes: deg(0)=1, deg(2)=0, deg(4)=1, deg(5)=0, deg(7)=1, deg(10)=3\n    Degrees of remaining H nodes: deg(2)=3, deg(4)=1, deg(6)=0, deg(8)=0, deg(9)=1, deg(13)=1\n\n    Map the unique deg 3 node:\n    *   G_node 10 (deg 3) must map to H_node 2 (deg 3). So, $f(10) = 2$.\n\n    **Partial Mapping (Set 5):**\n    $f(10) = 2$\n\n    Check G_node 10 and its mapped neighbors:\n    G_node 10 neighbors: {4, 7, 8}\n    Mapped H neighbors: {$f(4)$, $f(7)$, $f(8)=14$}\n    H_node 2 neighbors: {4, 13, 14}\n    Degrees of G_node 10 neighbors: deg(4)=1, deg(7)=1, deg(8)=3\n    Degrees of H_node 2 neighbors: deg(4)=1, deg(13)=1, deg(14)=3\n    Consistent.\n\n    From G_node 10 mapping:\n    *   G_nodes {4, 7} (both deg 1) must map to H_nodes {4, 13} (both deg 1). Let's try $f(4) = 4$ and $f(7) = 13$.\n\n    **Partial Mapping (Set 6):**\n    $f(4) = 4$\n    $f(7) = 13$\n\n    Remaining unmapped nodes:\n    G: {0, 2, 5}\n    H: {6, 8, 9}\n\n    Degrees of remaining G nodes: deg(0)=1, deg(2)=0, deg(5)=0\n    Degrees of remaining H nodes: deg(6)=0, deg(8)=0, deg(9)=1\n\n    Map the remaining unique deg 1 node:\n    *   G_node 0 (deg 1) must map to H_node 9 (deg 1). So, $f(0) = 9$.\n    Map the remaining deg 0 nodes:\n    *   G_nodes {2, 5} (both deg 0) must map to H_nodes {6, 8} (both deg 0). Let's try $f(2) = 6$ and $f(5) = 8$.\n\n    **Complete Proposed Mapping $f$:**\n    G-node $\\to$ H-node\n    0 $\\to$ 9\n    1 $\\to$ 12\n    2 $\\to$ 6\n    3 $\\to$ 7\n    4 $\\to$ 4\n    5 $\\to$ 8\n    6 $\\to$ 11\n    7 $\\to$ 13\n    8 $\\to$ 14\n    9 $\\to$ 1\n    10 $\\to$ 2\n    11 $\\to$ 10\n    12 $\\to$ 5\n    13 $\\to$ 3\n    14 $\\to$ 0\n\n4.  **Final Verification of the Mapping:**\n    We must now verify that for every edge $(u,v)$ in G, $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H, and vice versa. This can be done by checking the adjacency matrices for all pairs. Since the number of edges is the same, if all edges from G map correctly to H, then non-edges will also map correctly.\n\n    Let's list the edges in G and check their images in H using the proposed $f$:\n    *   (0,14) in G $\\implies$ (f(0),f(14)) = (9,0) in H. H[9,0]=1. (OK)\n    *   (1,9) in G $\\implies$ (f(1),f(9)) = (12,1) in H. H[12,1]=1. (OK)\n    *   (1,12) in G $\\implies$ (f(1),f(12)) = (12,5) in H. H[12,5]=1. (OK)\n    *   (3,6) in G $\\implies$ (f(3),f(6)) = (7,11) in H. H[7,11]=1. (OK)\n    *   (3,8) in G $\\implies$ (f(3),f(8)) = (7,14) in H. H[7,14]=1. (OK)\n    *   (3,11) in G $\\implies$ (f(3),f(11)) = (7,10) in H. H[7,10]=1. (OK)\n    *   (3,14) in G $\\implies$ (f(3),f(14)) = (7,0) in H. H[7,0]=1.

Yes, H[3][4]=1.\n*   This is consistent, so we map:\n    *   $\\phi(G0) = H3$\n\n**Step 4: Map the degree 2 nodes based on their neighbors.**\n*   G has two degree 2 nodes: G1 and G3.\n    *   G3 is adjacent to G8 (deg 4) and G1 (deg 2).\n    *   G1 is adjacent to G3 (deg 2) and G2 (deg 1).\n*   H has two degree 2 nodes: H5 and H7.\n    *   H7 is adjacent to H4 (deg 4) and H5 (deg 2).\n    *   H5 is adjacent to H7 (deg 2) and H2 (deg 1).\n*   This suggests:\n    *   $\\phi(G3) = H7$ (both are adjacent to the degree-4 node)\n    *   $\\phi(G1) = H5$ (both are not adjacent to the degree-4 node, but are adjacent to the other degree-2 node)\n\n**Step 5: Map the remaining degree 1 nodes based on their neighbors.**\nLet's list the neighbors of the already mapped nodes and identify the unmapped degree 1 neighbors.\n\n*   **Neighbors of G8 (mapped to H4):** {G0, G3, G9, G10}\n    *   G0 mapped to H3.\n    *   G3 mapped to H7.\n    *   Remaining G9, G10 (both deg 1) must map to remaining neighbors of H4 {H1, H10} (both deg 1).\n    *   Let's map: $\\phi(G9) = H1$ and $\\phi(G10) = H10$ (arbitrary assignment due to symmetry).\n\n*   **Neighbors of G0 (mapped to H3):** {G5, G6, G8}\n    *   G8 mapped to H4.\n    *   Remaining G5, G6 (both deg 1) must map to remaining neighbors of H3 {H6, H9} (both deg 1).\n    *   Let's map: $\\phi(G5) = H6$ and $\\phi(G6) = H9$ (arbitrary assignment).\n\n*   **Neighbors of G1 (mapped to H5):** {G2, G3}\n    *   G3 mapped to H7.\n    *   Remaining G2 (deg 1) must map to remaining neighbor of H5 {H2} (deg 1).\n    *   Map: $\\phi(G2) = H2$.\n\n**Summary of Proposed Isomorphism Mapping $\\phi$:**\n\n*   $\\phi(G0) = H3$\n*   $\\phi(G1) = H5$\n*   $\\phi(G2) = H2$\n*   $\\phi(G3) = H7$\n*   $\\phi(G4) = H0$\n*   $\\phi(G5) = H6$\n*   $\\phi(G6) = H9$\n*   $\\phi(G7) = H8$\n*   $\\phi(G8) = H4$\n*   $\\phi(G9) = H1$\n*   $\\phi(G10) = H10$\n\n**3. Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\n\nWe need to check that for every edge (u, v) in G, there is an edge ($\\phi(u), \\phi(v)$) in H, and vice-versa. Since the number of edges is the same, checking one direction is sufficient.\n\nLet's list all edges from G and their mapped counterparts in H:\n1.  G(0,5) $\\to$ H(3,6) - Yes (H[3][6]=1)\n2.  G(0,6) $\\to$ H(3,9) - Yes (H[3][9]=1)\n3.  G(0,8) $\\to$ H(3,4) - Yes (H[3][4]=1)\n4.  G(1,2) $\\to$ H(5,2) - Yes (H[5][2]=1)\n5.  G(1,3) $\\to$ H(5,7) - Yes (H[5][7]=1)\n6.  G(3,8) $\\to$ H(7,4) - Yes (H[7][4]=1)\n7.  G(4,7) $\\to$ H(0,8) - Yes (H[0][8]=1)\n8.  G(8,9) $\\to$ H(4,1) - Yes (H[4][1]=1)\n9.  G(8,10) $\\to$ H(4,10) - Yes (H[4][10]=1)\n\nAll 9 edges in G are preserved in H under the mapping $\\phi$.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGraphs G and H have the same number of vertices, the same number of edges, identical degree sequences, and the same connected component structure. Furthermore, we have successfully constructed a bijection between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency relationships.\n\nTherefore, **Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic**.",

So, N_G = 11.\n2.  **Degrees of Vertices (deg_G):**\n    *   deg(0) = 1 (connected to 2)\n    *   deg(1) = 2 (connected to 3, 5)\n    *   deg(2) = 3 (connected to 0, 5, 7)\n    *   deg(3) = 1 (connected to 1)\n    *   deg(4) = 3 (connected to 6, 8, 10)\n    *   deg(5) = 3 (connected to 1, 2, 7)\n    *   deg(6) = 2 (connected to 4, 9)\n    *   deg(7) = 4 (connected to 2, 5, 8, 9)\n    *   deg(8) = 2 (connected to 4, 7)\n    *   deg(9) = 3 (connected to 6, 7, 10)\n    *   deg(10) = 2 (connected to 4, 9)\n    Therefore, the degree sequence for G is: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2]`\n3.  **Sorted Degree Sequence (SD_G):** `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]`\n4.  **Number of Edges (M_G):** The sum of degrees is 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 26.

We need to investigate their structure.\n\n**2. Graph Structure and Connected Components:**\n\nLet's identify the connected components for each graph.\n\n**Graph G Components:**\nUsing the degrees and adjacency lists (implicit from the matrix):\n*   Nodes with degree 3: G6\n*   Nodes with degree 2: G4, G7\n*   Nodes with degree 1: G0, G1, G2, G3, G5, G8, G9\n\nLet's trace connections starting from nodes with higher degrees or isolated nodes:\n1.  **Component 1 (G_C1):** Start with G6 (deg 3).\n    *   G6 is connected to G2, G7, G8.\n    *   G2 (deg 1) is a leaf.\n    *   G8 (deg 1) is a leaf.\n    *   G7 (deg 2) is connected to G3 (deg 1) and G6. G3 is a leaf.\n    Structure: G3 - G7 - G6 - G2 and G6 - G8. This is a 5-node component: {G2, G3, G6, G7, G8}. It has 4 edges: (G2,G6), (G6,G7), (G6,G8), (G7,G3).\n\n2.  **Component 2 (G_C2):** Start with G4 (deg 2).\n    *   G4 is connected to G0 (deg 1) and G9 (deg 1). Both are leaves.\n    Structure: G0 - G4 - G9. This is a 3-node path (P3): {G0, G4, G9}. It has 2 edges: (G0,G4), (G4,G9).\n\n3.  **Component 3 (G_C3):** The remaining nodes are G1 and G5.\n    *   G1 (deg 1) is connected to G5 (deg 1).\n    Structure: G1 - G5. This is a 2-node path (P2): {G1, G5}. It has 1 edge: (G1,G5).\n\nGraph G is disconnected, consisting of three components:\n*   G_C1: 5 vertices, 4 edges, degrees {1,1,1,2,3} (within component) - a \"star with a path arm\".\n*   G_C2: 3 vertices, 2 edges, degrees {1,1,2} (within component) - a P3 (path of length 2).\n*   G_C3: 2 vertices, 1 edge, degrees {1,1} (within component) - a P2 (path of length 1).\n\n**Graph H Components:**\n*   Nodes with degree 3: H0\n*   Nodes with degree 2: H7, H9\n*   Nodes with degree 1: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H8\n\nLet's trace connections similarly for H:\n1.  **Component 1 (H_C1):** Start with H0 (deg 3).\n    *   H0 is connected to H5, H8, H9.\n    *   H5 (deg 1) is a leaf.\n    *   H8 (deg 1) is a leaf.\n    *   H9 (deg 2) is connected to H6 (deg 1) and H0. H6 is a leaf.\n    Structure: H6 - H9 - H0 - H5 and H0 - H8. This is a 5-node component: {H0, H5, H6, H8, H9}. It has 4 edges: (H0,H5), (H0,H8), (H0,H9), (H9,H6).\n\n2.  **Component 2 (H_C2):** Start with H7 (deg 2).\n    *   H7 is connected to H3 (deg 1) and H4 (deg 1). Both are leaves.\n    Structure: H3 - H7 - H4. This is a 3-node path (P3): {H3, H7, H4}. It has 2 edges: (H3,H7), (H4,H7).\n\n3.  **Component 3 (H_C3):** The remaining nodes are H1 and H2.\n    *   H1 (deg 1) is connected to H2 (deg 1).\n    Structure: H1 - H2. This is a 2-node path (P2): {H1, H2}. It has 1 edge: (H1,H2).\n\nGraph H is disconnected, consisting of three components:\n*   H_C1: 5 vertices, 4 edges, degrees {1,1,1,2,3} (within component) - a \"star with a path arm\".\n*   H_C2: 3 vertices, 2 edges, degrees {1,1,2} (within component) - a P3 (path of length 2).\n*   H_C3: 2 vertices, 1 edge, degrees {1,1} (within component) - a P2 (path of length 1).\n\n**3. Comparison of Components:**\n\nWe found that both Graph G and Graph H consist of three connected components with identical structures:\n*   A 5-vertex component with one degree-3 node, one degree-2 node, and three degree-1 nodes, forming a structure of a central node connected to two leaves and one end of a two-edge path (whose other end is a leaf).\n    *   G_C1: G6 (deg 3), G7 (deg 2), G2, G8, G3 (deg 1)\n    *   H_C1: H0 (deg 3), H9 (deg 2), H5, H8, H6 (deg 1)\n    These components are isomorphic. For example, map G6 to H0, G7 to H9, G3 to H6, G2 to H5, G8 to H8.\n\n*   A 3-vertex path graph (P3).\n    *   G_C2: G0 - G4 - G9\n    *   H_C2: H3 - H7 - H4\n    These components are isomorphic. For example, map G4 to H7, G0 to H3, G9 to H4.\n\n*   A 2-vertex path graph (P2).\n    *   G_C3: G1 - G5\n    *   H_C3: H1 - H2\n    These components are isomorphic. For example, map G1 to H1, G5 to H2.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nSince Graphs G and H have the same number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and their corresponding connected components are themselves isomorphic, we can conclude that Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\nA possible isomorphism mapping `f: V(G) -> V(H)` is:\n*   `f(G0) = H3`\n*   `f(G1) = H1`\n*   `f(G2) = H5`\n*   `f(G3) = H6`\n*   `f(G4) = H7`\n*   `f(G5) = H2`\n*   `f(G6) = H0`\n*   `f(G7) = H9`\n*   `f(G8) = H8`\n*   `f(G9) = H4`\n\nThis mapping preserves all adjacencies. For example, G6 is connected to G2, G7, G8. Under the mapping, H0 (f(G6)) is connected to H5 (f(G2)), H9 (f(G7)), H8 (f(G8)), which is true in Graph H. All other adjacencies (and non-adjacencies) would similarly be preserved.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

This is a path of length 2 (P3), or also known as K$_{1,2}$.\n\n**3. Compare Components:**\n\nBoth graphs have:\n*   5 isolated vertices (K1).\n*   2 components that are a single edge (P2 or K2).\n*   1 component that is a 3-vertex path/star graph (P3 or K$_{1,2}$).\n\nThe number and type of connected components are identical for both graphs. This is a very strong indicator of isomorphism.\n\n**4. Construct a Bijection (Isomorphism Mapping):**\n\nWe can define a mapping $\\phi: V(G) \\to V(H)$ that preserves adjacency.\n\n*   **Map Isolated Vertices:** (Any permutation works)\n    *   $\\phi(v0_G) = v0_H$\n    *   $\\phi(v5_G) = v3_H$\n    *   $\\phi(v6_G) = v4_H$\n    *   $\\phi(v8_G) = v9_H$\n    *   $\\phi(v9_G) = v10_H$\n\n*   **Map P2 Components:**\n    *   For (v1_G)-(v11_G) and (v1_H)-(v11_H):\n        *   $\\phi(v1_G) = v1_H$\n        *   $\\phi(v11_G) = v11_H$\n    *   For (v2_G)-(v10_G) and (v5_H)-(v6_H):\n        *   $\\phi(v2_G) = v5_H$\n        *   $\\phi(v10_G) = v6_H$\n\n*   **Map P3 (Star) Components:**\n    *   G's star: center v7_G (deg 2), leaves v3_G (deg 1), v4_G (deg 1).\n    *   H's star: center v2_H (deg 2), leaves v7_H (deg 1), v8_H (deg 1).\n    *   Map centers:\n        *   $\\phi(v7_G) = v2_H$\n    *   Map leaves (order doesn't matter for leaves of a star):\n        *   $\\phi(v3_G) = v7_H$\n        *   $\\phi(v4_G) = v8_H$\n\n**Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\n\nLet's check if $(u,v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(\\phi(u),\\phi(v))$ is an edge in H using the mapping above.\n\n*   Edge (1,11) in G: $\\phi(1) = 1$, $\\phi(11) = 11$. Is (1,11) an edge in H? Yes.\n*   Edge (2,10) in G: $\\phi(2) = 5$, $\\phi(10) = 6$. Is (5,6) an edge in H? Yes.\n*   Edge (3,7) in G: $\\phi(3) = 7$, $\\phi(7) = 2$. Is (7,2) an edge in H? Yes.\n*   Edge (4,7) in G: $\\phi(4) = 8$, $\\phi(7) = 2$. Is (8,2) an edge in H? Yes.\n\nAll edges in G map to edges in H, and since both graphs have the same number of edges and vertices, and the mapping is a bijection, it implies that all edges in H are covered by this mapping from G.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the matching structure of their connected components, and the successful construction of an adjacency-preserving bijection, we can conclude that **Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.**",

Connected Components and Structural Analysis:**\n\nLet's identify the types of nodes based on their degrees and then trace connected components.\n\n**Graph G Nodes by Degree:**\n*   Degree 0: {v1, v3, v10} (3 nodes)\n*   Degree 1: {v0, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9} (7 nodes)\n*   Degree 2: {v11} (1 node)\n*   Degree 3: {v2} (1 node)\n\n**Graph H Nodes by Degree:**\n*   Degree 0: {u2, u5, u9} (3 nodes)\n*   Degree 1: {u0, u3, u4, u6, u7, u10, u11} (7 nodes)\n*   Degree 2: {u8} (1 node)\n*   Degree 3: {u1} (1 node)\n\n**Connected Components of G:**\n1.  **Isolated Nodes (Degree 0):** v1, v3, v10. (3 components, each a single vertex)\n2.  **Edge Components (Degree 1-1):**\n    *   v0 (deg 1) is connected only to v8 (deg 1). Component: {v0, v8} (an edge, $P_2$)\n    *   v4 (deg 1) is connected only to v9 (deg 1). Component: {v4, v9} (an edge, $P_2$)\n3.  **Larger Component:**\n    *   v2 (deg 3) is connected to v5 (deg 1), v7 (deg 1), and v11 (deg 2).\n    *   v11 (deg 2) is connected to v2 (deg 3) and v6 (deg 1).\n    *   This component includes {v2, v5, v7, v11, v6}.\n    *   Structure: v5-v2-v7, and v2-v11-v6. This is a path P4 (v5-v2-v11-v6) with a pendant edge (v2-v7).\n    *   Degrees within this component: deg(v2)=3, deg(v5)=1, deg(v7)=1, deg(v11)=2, deg(v6)=1.\n\n**Connected Components of H:**\n1.  **Isolated Nodes (Degree 0):** u2, u5, u9. (3 components, each a single vertex)\n2.  **Edge Components (Degree 1-1):**\n    *   u4 (deg 1) is connected only to u6 (deg 1). Component: {u4, u6} (an edge, $P_2$)\n    *   u7 (deg 1) is connected only to u11 (deg 1). Component: {u7, u11} (an edge, $P_2$)\n3.  **Larger Component:**\n    *   u1 (deg 3) is connected to u0 (deg 1), u3 (deg 1), and u8 (deg 2).\n    *   u8 (deg 2) is connected to u1 (deg 3) and u10 (deg 1).\n    *   This component includes {u1, u0, u3, u8, u10}.\n    *   Structure: u0-u1-u3, and u1-u8-u10. This is a path P4 (u0-u1-u8-u10) with a pendant edge (u1-u3).\n    *   Degrees within this component: deg(u1)=3, deg(u0)=1, deg(u3)=1, deg(u8)=2, deg(u10)=1.\n\n**Component Comparison:**\nBoth graphs exhibit the same set of connected components:\n*   3 isolated vertices (degree 0).\n*   2 components consisting of a single edge ($P_2$ path, two degree-1 vertices).\n*   1 component with 5 vertices, structured as a $P_4$ path with an additional pendant edge attached to the central node of the $P_4$. (Degrees: one degree-3, one degree-2, three degree-1).\n\nSince the components are structurally identical, the graphs are likely isomorphic. We can now propose an explicit isomorphism mapping.\n\n**3. Constructing an Isomorphism Mapping:**\n\nLet's define a mapping $f: V(G) \\to V(H)$ that preserves adjacencies.\n\n*   **Mapping the \"complex\" component:**\n    *   Map the central node with degree 3: `f(v2) = u1`\n    *   v2's neighbors are v5 (deg 1), v7 (deg 1), v11 (deg 2).\n    *   u1's neighbors are u0 (deg 1), u3 (deg 1), u8 (deg 2).\n    *   Map the degree-2 neighbor: `f(v11) = u8`\n    *   Map the degree-1 neighbors arbitrarily:\n        *   `f(v5) = u0`\n        *   `f(v7) = u3`\n    *   Now, check v11's other neighbor: v6 (deg 1). u8's other neighbor is u10 (deg 1). So:\n        *   `f(v6) = u10`\n\n*   **Mapping the isolated nodes:**\n    *   `f(v1) = u2`\n    *   `f(v3) = u5`\n    *   `f(v10) = u9`\n    (Any permutation of these is valid as they are indistinguishable.)\n\n*   **Mapping the edge components:**\n    *   For {v0, v8} (deg 1, deg 1) and {u4, u6} (deg 1, deg 1):\n        *   `f(v0) = u4`\n        *   `f(v8) = u6`\n    *   For {v4, v9} (deg 1, deg 1) and {u7, u11} (deg 1, deg 1):\n        *   `f(v4) = u7`\n        *   `f(v9) = u11`\n    (Again, pairs can be swapped, and the two edges can be swapped.)\n\n**The complete proposed mapping $f$:**\n*   `f(v0) = u4`\n*   `f(v1) = u2`\n*   `f(v2) = u1`\n*   `f(v3) = u5`\n*   `f(v4) = u7`\n*   `f(v5) = u0`\n*   `f(v6) = u10`\n*   `f(v7) = u3`\n*   `f(v8) = u6`\n*   `f(v9) = u11`\n*   `f(v10) = u9`\n*   `f(v11) = u8`\n\n**4. Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\n\nWe check if for every edge (x, y) in G, (f(x), f(y)) is an edge in H, and for every non-edge (x, y) in G, (f(x), f(y)) is a non-edge in H. Since the number of edges is the same, we only need to verify that all edges are preserved.\n\n**Edges in G:**\n1.  (v0, v8): `f(v0)=u4, f(v8)=u6`. Is (u4, u6) an edge in H? Yes (A_H[4][6]=1).\n2.  (v2, v5): `f(v2)=u1, f(v5)=u0`. Is (u1, u0) an edge in H? Yes (A_H[1][0]=1).\n3.  (v2, v7): `f(v2)=u1, f(v7)=u3`. Is (u1, u3) an edge in H? Yes (A_H[1][3]=1).\n4.  (v2, v11): `f(v2)=u1, f(v11)=u8`. Is (u1, u8) an edge in H? Yes (A_H[1][8]=1).\n5.  (v4, v9): `f(v4)=u7, f(v9)=u11`. Is (u7, u11) an edge in H? Yes (A_H[7][11]=1).\n6.  (v6, v11): `f(v6)=u10, f(v11)=u8`. Is (u10, u8) an edge in H? Yes (A_H[10][8]=1).\n\nAll 6 edges in G are mapped to existing edges in H. Since both graphs have 6 edges, and the mapping is a bijection, this confirms that non-edges also map correctly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the matching basic invariants (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence) and the structural decomposition into identical connected components, along with the successful construction and verification of an explicit isomorphism mapping, we can conclude that the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the two graphs are isomorphic.",

So, $\\phi(G_1) = H_6$.\n        *   From $G_1$, next in cycle is $G_{11}$. $\\phi(G_{11})$ must be a neighbor of $\\phi(G_1) = H_6$ (and not $H_4$). $H_6$ is connected to $H_3$ and $H_4$. So, $\\phi(G_{11}) = H_3$.\n        *   From $G_{11}$, next in cycle is $G_8$. $\\phi(G_8)$ must be a neighbor of $\\phi(G_{11}) = H_3$ (and not $H_6$). $H_3$ is connected to $H_5$ and $H_6$. So, $\\phi(G_8) = H_5$. (This matches our earlier assignment for $\\phi(G_8)$).\n        *   Finally, check if $\\phi(G_8)$ connects back to $\\phi(G_0)$: $(H_5, H_2)$.

Connected Components Analysis:**\nLet's analyze the structure of the connected components for each graph.\n\n*   **Graph G Components:**\n    *   **Isolated Vertices (degree 0):** {0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 11}. There are 6 isolated vertices, each forming a component of type P1 (path of length 0).\n    *   **Non-isolated Vertices:** {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13}\n        *   Consider the subgraph induced by {2, 3, 4, 9}:\n            *   Edges: (2,3), (2,4), (4,9)\n            *   Degrees within this component: deg(3)=1, deg(2)=2, deg(4)=2, deg(9)=1.\n            *   This is a path graph P4: 3-2-4-9.\n        *   Consider the subgraph induced by {6, 7, 12, 13}:\n            *   Edges: (6,13), (7,12), (7,13)\n            *   Degrees within this component: deg(6)=1, deg(7)=2, deg(12)=1, deg(13)=2.\n            *   This is also a path graph P4: 12-7-13-6.\n    *   **Summary for G:** 6 isolated vertices (P1 components) and 2 Path-4 components (P4).\n\n*   **Graph H Components:**\n    *   **Isolated Vertices (degree 0):** {0, 3, 7, 10, 12, 13}. There are 6 isolated vertices (P1 components).\n    *   **Non-isolated Vertices:** {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11}\n        *   Consider the subgraph induced by {1, 2, 5, 9}:\n            *   Edges: (1,2), (1,5), (5,9)\n            *   Degrees within this component: deg(2)=1, deg(1)=2, deg(5)=2, deg(9)=1.\n            *   This is a path graph P4: 2-1-5-9.\n        *   Consider the subgraph induced by {4, 6, 8, 11}:\n            *   Edges: (4,8), (6,11), (8,11)\n            *   Degrees within this component: deg(4)=1, deg(6)=1, deg(8)=2, deg(11)=2.\n            *   This is also a path graph P4: 4-8-11-6.\n    *   **Summary for H:** 6 isolated vertices (P1 components) and 2 Path-4 components (P4).\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nBoth Graph G and Graph H have:\n*   The same number of vertices (14).\n*   The same number of edges (6).\n*   Identical degree sequences ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]).\n*   Identical structure of connected components: 6 isolated vertices and 2 path graphs of 4 vertices (P4).\n\nSince all graph invariants examined match and the structure of their components is identical, we can confidently conclude that the graphs are isomorphic. We can even construct a possible isomorphism mapping $\\phi$:\n\n*   Map isolated nodes to isolated nodes (there are many ways to do this):\n    *   $\\phi(0) = 0$\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 3$\n    *   $\\phi(5) = 7$\n    *   $\\phi(8) = 10$\n    *   $\\phi(10) = 12$\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 13$\n\n*   Map the first P4 of G (3-2-4-9) to the first P4 of H (2-1-5-9) based on degrees and adjacencies:\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 2$ (both deg 1 endpoints)\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 1$ (both deg 2, connected to their respective \"3\" and \"2\" image)\n    *   $\\phi(4) = 5$ (both deg 2, connected to their respective \"2\" and \"9\" image)\n    *   $\\phi(9) = 9$ (both deg 1 endpoints)\n\n*   Map the second P4 of G (12-7-13-6) to the second P4 of H (4-8-11-6) based on degrees and adjacencies:\n    *   $\\phi(12) = 4$ (both deg 1 endpoints)\n    *   $\\phi(7) = 8$ (both deg 2, connected to their respective \"12\" and \"4\" image)\n    *   $\\phi(13) = 11$ (both deg 2, connected to their respective \"7\" and \"6\" image)\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 6$ (both deg 1 endpoints)\n\nThis bijection $\\phi$ preserves all adjacency relationships, confirming the isomorphism.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes, the graphs are isomorphic}$.",

Since `f(v2) = u5`, `f(v7)` must be connected to `u5`. The only neighbor of `u5` in H is `u3`. So, `f(v7) = u3`.\n    *   v5 is connected to v8. Since `f(v5) = u7`, `f(v8)` must be connected to `u7`. The only neighbor of `u7` in H is `u8`. So, `f(v8) = u8`.\n\n    Next, map the remaining degree-2 nodes:\n    *   v7 is connected to v2 and v3. We have `f(v7) = u3` and `f(v2) = u5`. `u3` is connected to `u5` and `u4`. So, `f(v3)` must be `u4`. `f(v3) = u4`.\n    *   v8 is connected to v4 and v5. We have `f(v8) = u8` and `f(v5) = u7`. `u8` is connected to `u7` and `u0`.

Is (u5, u3) an edge in H? Yes (H[5][3]=1).\n    *   (v3, v4) is an edge in G.\n        *   `f(v3) = u4`, `f(v4) = u0`. Is (u4, u0) an edge in H? Yes (H[4][0]=1).\n    *   (v3, v7) is an edge in G.\n        *   `f(v3) = u4`, `f(v7) = u3`. Is (u4, u3) an edge in H? Yes (H[4][3]=1).\n    *   (v4, v8) is an edge in G.\n        *   `f(v4) = u0`, `f(v8) = u8`. Is (u0, u8) an edge in H? Yes (H[0][8]=1).\n    *   (v5, v8) is an edge in G.\n        *   `f(v5) = u7`, `f(v8) = u8`. Is (u7, u8) an edge in H? Yes (H[7][8]=1).\n\nAll 5 edges in G map directly to the 5 edges in H. Since the total number of edges is the same, this implies that all non-edges in G also map to non-edges in H. The mapping is a valid isomorphism.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the matching graph invariants (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and connected component structure) and the successful construction and verification of a bijective mapping that preserves adjacency, we can conclude that Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

Since both graphs have the same number of vertices and edges, verifying this one direction is sufficient.\n\n    Edges in G:\n    1.  (1,4) in G $\\implies$ (f(1),f(4)) = (12,0) in H. (Yes, H[12,0]=1)\n    2.  (2,8) in G $\\implies$ (f(2),f(8)) = (1,6) in H. (Yes, H[1,6]=1)\n    3.  (2,11) in G $\\implies$ (f(2),f(11)) = (1,5) in H. (Yes, H[1,5]=1)\n    4.  (4,5) in G $\\implies$ (f(4),f(5)) = (0,9) in H. (Yes, H[0,9]=1)\n    5.  (5,12) in G $\\implies$ (f(5),f(12)) = (9,11) in H. (Yes, H[9,11]=1)\n    6.  (6,8) in G $\\implies$ (f(6),f(8)) = (3,6) in H. (Yes, H[3,6]=1)\n    7.  (7,12) in G $\\implies$ (f(7),f(12)) = (4,11) in H. (Yes, H[4,11]=1)\n\nAll edges in G are preserved by the mapping in H.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll necessary conditions for isomorphism (same number of vertices, edges, degree sequence) are met. Furthermore, a valid bijective mapping that preserves adjacency has been successfully constructed and verified.\n\nTherefore, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

H has one node with degree 0: H_5.\n        *   **`f(G_4) = H_5`**\n    *   G has one node with degree 4: G_10. H has one node with degree 4: H_4.\n        *   **`f(G_10) = H_4`**\n\n2.  **Map Neighbors of Degree-4 Nodes:**\n    *   Neighbors of G_10: {G_2 (deg 3), G_5 (deg 2), G_11 (deg 2), G_14 (deg 2)}.\n    *   Neighbors of H_4: {H_3 (deg 2), H_7 (deg 2), H_10 (deg 2), H_14 (deg 3)}.\n    *   The only degree-3 neighbor of G_10 is G_2. The only degree-3 neighbor of H_4 is H_14.\n        *   **`f(G_2) = H_14`**\n\n3.  **Map Shared Neighbors and Paths:**\n    *   G_5 is a neighbor of G_10 (deg 4) and G_2 (deg 3). G_5 is deg 2.\n    *   H_3 is a neighbor of H_4 (deg 4) and H_14 (deg 3). H_3 is deg 2.\n    *   This suggests: **`f(G_5) = H_3`** (Check: $A_G[2][5]=1$ and $A_H[14][3]=1$. Yes.)\n\n    *   Now consider G_2's other unmapped neighbor: G_3 (deg 2).\n    *   H_14's other unmapped neighbor: H_2 (deg 2).\n    *   This suggests: **`f(G_3) = H_2`** (Check: $A_G[2][3]=1$ and $A_H[14][2]=1$. Yes.)\n\n4.  **Map Degree-3 Nodes:**\n    *   G has two deg-3 nodes: G_2 (already mapped to H_14) and G_13.\n    *   H has two deg-3 nodes: H_14 (already mapped to G_2) and H_11.\n    *   So, G_13 must map to H_11:\n        *   **`f(G_13) = H_11`**\n\n5.  **Map Neighbors of Degree-3 Nodes:**\n    *   Neighbors of G_13: {G_0 (deg 2), G_1 (deg 1), G_8 (deg 2)}.\n    *   Neighbors of H_11: {H_1 (deg 1), H_12 (deg 2), H_13 (deg 2)}.\n    *   The only degree-1 neighbor of G_13 is G_1. The only degree-1 neighbor of H_11 is H_1.\n        *   **`f(G_1) = H_1`**\n    *   The remaining deg-2 neighbors {G_0, G_8} must map to {H_12, H_13}.\n\n6.  **Refine Mapping for Remaining Degree-2 Neighbors of G_10/H_4:**\n    *   G_10's remaining neighbors: {G_11 (deg 2), G_14 (deg 2)}.\n    *   H_4's remaining neighbors: {H_7 (deg 2), H_10 (deg 2)}.\n    *   Let's check who G_11 and G_14 are connected to, besides G_10:\n        *   G_11 is connected to G_6 (deg 2).\n        *   G_14 is connected to G_0 (deg 2).\n    *   Let's check who H_7 and H_10 are connected to, besides H_4:\n        *   H_7 is connected to H_13 (deg 2).\n        *   H_10 is connected to H_0 (deg 2).\n    *   We also know from step 5 that `f(G_0)` maps to either H_12 or H_13.\n    *   If `f(G_14) = H_7`, then its neighbor `f(G_0)` must be `H_13` (neighbor of H_7). This is consistent with `f(G_0) ∈ {H_12, H_13}`.\n        *   **`f(G_14) = H_7`**\n        *   **`f(G_0) = H_13`**\n    *   This forces the remaining deg-2 mappings:\n        *   **`f(G_11) = H_10`** (the remaining neighbor of G_10 to remaining neighbor of H_4)\n        *   **`f(G_8) = H_12`** (the remaining neighbor of G_13 from {G_0, G_8} mapping to {H_12, H_13})\n\n7.  **Map Remaining Nodes (Degree-1 and Degree-2):**\n    *   Current mapping for degree-2 nodes: G_0, G_3, G_5, G_8, G_11, G_12, G_14 are mapped. Remaining are G_6, G_9.\n    *   H_nodes mapped: H_2, H_3, H_7, H_8, H_10, H_12, H_13, H_14. Remaining are H_0, H_9.\n    *   G has one remaining deg-1 node: G_7. H has one remaining deg-1 node: H_6.\n        *   **`f(G_7) = H_6`**\n    *   G_7 is connected to G_9. H_6 is connected to H_9.\n        *   This implies **`f(G_9) = H_9`**\n    *   The only remaining node in G is G_6 (deg 2). The only remaining node in H is H_0 (deg 2).\n        *   **`f(G_6) = H_0`**\n\n8.  **Verify the Complete Mapping:**\n\n    Proposed Mapping `f(G_i) = H_j`:\n    *   `f(G_0) = H_13`\n    *   `f(G_1) = H_1`\n    *   `f(G_2) = H_14`\n    *   `f(G_3) = H_2`\n    *   `f(G_4) = H_5`\n    *   `f(G_5) = H_3`\n    *   `f(G_6) = H_0`\n    *   `f(G_7) = H_6`\n    *   `f(G_8) = H_12`\n    *   `f(G_9) = H_9`\n    *   `f(G_10) = H_4`\n    *   `f(G_11) = H_10`\n    *   `f(G_12) = H_8`\n    *   `f(G_13) = H_11`\n    *   `f(G_14) = H_7`\n\n    Now we verify if this mapping preserves all adjacencies. For every pair $(u, v)$ in G, $(u, v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H. A comprehensive check (as performed in thought process) confirms this. For example:\n    *   G_0 is connected to G_13 and G_14. H_13 is connected to H_11 (f(G_13)) and H_7 (f(G_14)). (Matches)\n    *   G_10 is connected to G_2, G_5, G_11, G_14. H_4 is connected to H_14 (f(G_2)), H_3 (f(G_5)), H_10 (f(G_11)), H_7 (f(G_14)). (Matches)\n    *   G_6 is connected to G_11, G_12. H_0 is connected to H_10 (f(G_11)), H_8 (f(G_12)). (Matches)\n    *   All connections, and non-connections, are preserved under this mapping.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the identical preliminary invariants and the successful construction of a vertex mapping that preserves all adjacencies, Graphs G and H are **isomorphic**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

Graph G contains a vertex (G[7]) with a degree of 0, meaning it is an isolated vertex. Graph H, however, has no isolated vertices, as all its vertices have a degree of at least 1.

This is a necessary condition for isomorphism.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate and compare the number of edges.**\nThe number of edges can be found by summing the degrees of all vertices and dividing by 2 (since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices).\n\n**For Graph G:**\nLet's calculate the degree of each vertex in G:\n*   deg(G0) = 1 (connected to G3)\n*   deg(G1) = 4 (connected to G2, G3, G5, G6)\n*   deg(G2) = 4 (connected to G1, G3, G7, G8)\n*   deg(G3) = 3 (connected to G0, G1, G2)\n*   deg(G4) = 2 (connected to G6, G9)\n*   deg(G5) = 3 (connected to G1, G6, G8)\n*   deg(G6) = 3 (connected to G1, G4, G5)\n*   deg(G7) = 2 (connected to G2, G8)\n*   deg(G8) = 3 (connected to G2, G5, G7)\n*   deg(G9) = 1 (connected to G4)\n\nSum of degrees for G = 1 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 26.\nNumber of edges in G = 26 / 2 = 13.\n\n**For Graph H:**\nLet's calculate the degree of each vertex in H:\n*   deg(H0) = 2 (connected to H3, H7)\n*   deg(H1) = 2 (connected to H5, H9)\n*   deg(H2) = 2 (connected to H7, H8)\n*   deg(H3) = 4 (connected to H0, H7, H8, H9)\n*   deg(H4) = 1 (connected to H9)\n*   deg(H5) = 2 (connected to H1, H8)\n*   deg(H6) = 1 (connected to H7)\n*   deg(H7) = 4 (connected to H0, H2, H3, H6)\n*   deg(H8) = 4 (connected to H2, H3, H5, H9)\n*   deg(H9) = 4 (connected to H1, H3, H4, H8)\n\nSum of degrees for H = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26.\nNumber of edges in H = 26 / 2 = 13.\n\nBoth graphs have 10 vertices and 13 edges. This condition is also met.\n\n**Step 3: Compare degree sequences.**\nA more stringent necessary condition for isomorphism is that the graphs must have the same degree sequence (the multiset of degrees of their vertices).\n\n*   **Degree sequence for G (sorted):**\n    [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n    (G0, G9 have degree 1; G4, G7 have degree 2; G3, G5, G6, G8 have degree 3; G1, G2 have degree 4)\n\n*   **Degree sequence for H (sorted):**\n    [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n    (H4, H6 have degree 1; H0, H1, H2, H5 have degree 2; H3, H7, H8, H9 have degree 4)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe degree sequence of Graph G is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4].\nThe degree sequence of Graph H is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4].\n\nSince the degree sequences are different (e.g., Graph G has four vertices of degree 3, while Graph H has none; Graph H has four vertices of degree 2, while Graph G has only two), the graphs cannot be isomorphic. An isomorphism must preserve the degree of each corresponding vertex, meaning their degree sequences must be identical.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe two graphs are **not isomorphic**. This is because their degree sequences are different.",

Yes.\n    *   Edge {6,7} in G: Is {f(6), f(7)} = {4,3} an edge in H?

This is a strong starting point.\n    *   Let `f(G2) = H6`.\n\n*   **Neighbors of G2:** {G0, G4, G6, G7, G9, G11}\n    *   Their degrees: {deg(G0)=3, deg(G4)=1, deg(G6)=3, deg(G7)=2, deg(G9)=3, deg(G11)=5}\n*   **Neighbors of H6:** {H0, H3, H5, H8, H9, H12}\n    *   Their degrees: {deg(H0)=3, deg(H3)=1, deg(H5)=3, deg(H8)=2, deg(H9)=3, deg(H12)=5}\n\n    The degrees of the neighbors match up. Let's map based on these degrees:\n    *   Map the highest degree neighbors: `f(G11) = H12` (both deg 5).\n\n*   **Now consider neighbors of G11 and H12:**\n    *   Neighbors of G11: {G1, G2, G6, G8, G12} (degrees: 1, 6, 3, 1, 2)\n    *   Neighbors of H12: {H1, H4, H6, H7, H9} (degrees: 1, 2, 6, 1, 3)\n    *   We already have `f(G2) = H6`. This is consistent (G2 is a neighbor of G11, H6 is a neighbor of H12).\n\n    Let's use the remaining unmapped neighbors:\n    *   `f(G6) = H9` (both deg 3)\n    *   `f(G12) = H4` (both deg 2)\n    *   G1 (deg 1) and G8 (deg 1) must map to H1 (deg 1) and H7 (deg 1). Let's tentatively set `f(G1) = H1` and `f(G8) = H7`.\n\n*   **Expanding the mapping using established relationships:**\n    *   From `f(G6) = H9`:\n        *   G6's neighbors: {G2, G9, G11}\n        *   H9's neighbors: {H5, H6, H12}\n        *   Since `f(G2)=H6` and `f(G11)=H12` are consistent, the remaining neighbor `G9` (deg 3) must map to `H5` (deg 3).\n        *   So, `f(G9) = H5`.\n\n    *   From `f(G12) = H4`:\n        *   G12's neighbors: {G0, G11}\n        *   H4's neighbors: {H0, H12}\n        *   Since `f(G11)=H12` is consistent, the remaining neighbor `G0` (deg 3) must map to `H0` (deg 3).\n        *   So, `f(G0) = H0`.\n\n    *   From `f(G0) = H0`:\n        *   G0's neighbors: {G2, G3, G12}\n        *   H0's neighbors: {H4, H6, H11}\n        *   We have `f(G2)=H6` and `f(G12)=H4`. The remaining neighbor `G3` (deg 1) must map to `H11` (deg 1).\n        *   So, `f(G3) = H11`.\n\n    *   From `f(G2) = H6` (revisit remaining neighbors):\n        *   G2's neighbors: {G0, G4, G6, G7, G9, G11}\n        *   H6's neighbors: {H0, H3, H5, H8, H9, H12}\n        *   Mapped so far: `f(G0)=H0`, `f(G6)=H9`, `f(G9)=H5`, `f(G11)=H12`.\n        *   Remaining neighbors for G2: G4 (deg 1), G7 (deg 2).\n        *   Remaining neighbors for H6: H3 (deg 1), H8 (deg 2).\n        *   So, `f(G4) = H3` and `f(G7) = H8`.\n\n    *   Isolated vertices (degree 0):\n        *   G5 and G10 are isolated. H2 and H10 are isolated.\n        *   We can map `f(G5) = H2` and `f(G10) = H10`. (The choice doesn't affect isomorphism as they are symmetric).\n\n**Proposed Isomorphism Mapping `f`:**\n\n*   `f(G0) = H0`\n*   `f(G1) = H1`\n*   `f(G2) = H6`\n*   `f(G3) = H11`\n*   `f(G4) = H3`\n*   `f(G5) = H2`\n*   `f(G6) = H9`\n*   `f(G7) = H8`\n*   `f(G8) = H7`\n*   `f(G9) = H5`\n*   `f(G10) = H10`\n*   `f(G11) = H12`\n*   `f(G12) = H4`\n\n**3. Verification of the Mapping:**\n\nWe must verify that for every pair of vertices `(u, v)`, `G[u][v] = 1` if and only if `H[f(u)][f(v)] = 1`. Since both graphs have the same number of edges, we just need to check if all edges in G are preserved in H under the mapping.\n\nList of edges in G (14 edges, derived from upper triangle of adjacency matrix, or by checking pairs where `G[u][v]=1` for `u<v`):\n1.  (G0,G2) -> `f(G0)=H0, f(G2)=H6`. Is (H0,H6) an edge? Yes, H[0][6]=1.\n2.  (G0,G3) -> `f(G0)=H0, f(G3)=H11`. Is (H0,H11) an edge? Yes, H[0][11]=1.\n3.  (G0,G12) -> `f(G0)=H0, f(G12)=H4`. Is (H0,H4) an edge? Yes, H[0][4]=1.\n4.  (G1,G11) -> `f(G1)=H1, f(G11)=H12`. Is (H1,H12) an edge? Yes, H[1][12]=1.\n5.  (G2,G4) -> `f(G2)=H6, f(G4)=H3`. Is (H6,H3) an edge? Yes, H[6][3]=1.\n6.  (G2,G6) -> `f(G2)=H6, f(G6)=H9`. Is (H6,H9) an edge? Yes, H[6][9]=1.\n7.  (G2,G7) -> `f(G2)=H6, f(G7)=H8`. Is (H6,H8) an edge? Yes, H[6][8]=1.\n8.  (G2,G9) -> `f(G2)=H6, f(G9)=H5`. Is (H6,H5) an edge? Yes, H[6][5]=1.\n9.  (G2,G11) -> `f(G2)=H6, f(G11)=H12`. Is (H6,H12) an edge? Yes, H[6][12]=1.\n10. (G6,G9) -> `f(G6)=H9, f(G9)=H5`. Is (H9,H5) an edge? Yes, H[9][5]=1.\n11. (G6,G11) -> `f(G6)=H9, f(G11)=H12`. Is (H9,H12) an edge? Yes, H[9][12]=1.\n12. (G7,G9) -> `f(G7)=H8, f(G9)=H5`. Is (H8,H5) an edge? Yes, H[8][5]=1.\n13. (G8,G11) -> `f(G8)=H7, f(G11)=H12`. Is (H7,H12) an edge? Yes, H[7][12]=1.\n14. (G11,G12) -> `f(G11)=H12, f(G12)=H4`. Is (H12,H4) an edge? Yes, H[12][4]=1.\n\nAll 14 edges of G are preserved as edges in H under the mapping `f`. Since the number of edges is the same, this guarantees that non-edges in G also map to non-edges in H.\n\nTherefore, the graphs G and H are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$",

So, $\\phi(V0_G) = V4_H$.\n        *   $V9_G$ is connected to $V8_G$. $V10_H$ is connected to $V8_H$. So, $\\phi(V9_G) = V10_H$.\n    *   Map the remaining degree 2 vertex in the P5:\n        *   $V10_G$ is connected to $V0_G$ and $V9_G$. $V3_H$ is connected to $V4_H$ and $V10_H$.\n        *   Since $\\phi(V0_G) = V4_H$ and $\\phi(V9_G) = V10_H$, we set $\\phi(V10_G) = V3_H$.\n\n    The mapping for the connected component is:\n    *   $\\phi(V0_G) = V4_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V2_G) = V6_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V8_G) = V8_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V9_G) = V10_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V10_G) = V3_H$\n\n    Now, map the isolated vertices from G to the isolated vertices in H. Any one-to-one mapping is valid.\n    Isolated vertices in G: {V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7}\n    Isolated vertices in H: {V0, V1, V2, V5, V7, V9}\n    A possible mapping:\n    *   $\\phi(V1_G) = V0_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V3_G) = V1_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V4_G) = V2_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V5_G) = V5_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V6_G) = V7_H$\n    *   $\\phi(V7_G) = V9_H$\n\n    This bijection $\\phi$ preserves adjacency and demonstrates that the two graphs are indeed isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

According to our mapping, this edge should correspond to `(f(4), f(5)) = (1, 3)` in H. Looking at H's adjacency matrix, `A[1][3]=1`, so `(1, 3)` is indeed an edge in H.\n    *   For any other pair of vertices `(u, v)` in G, they are not connected. For example, `(4, 0)` is not an edge in G. `f(4)=1, f(0)=0`. `(1, 0)` is not an edge in H (`A[1][0]=0`). This holds for all other pairs as well, as all other nodes are isolated in both graphs.\n\nSince we found a bijection that preserves adjacency, the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic. They both represent a graph with 11 vertices, where exactly two vertices are connected by an edge, and the remaining nine vertices are isolated (have a degree of zero). The specific labels of the vertices don't change the underlying structure.",

Finding a Bijective Mapping that Preserves Adjacency**\n\nWe will try to construct a mapping `f: V_G -> V_H` based on vertex properties.\n\n*   **Unique Degree Nodes:**\n    *   Node with degree 0: `v1` in G, `u4` in H.\n        *   Thus, we must have `f(v1) = u4`.\n    *   Node with degree 3: `v8` in G, `u5` in H.\n        *   Thus, we must have `f(v8) = u5`.\n\n*   **Mapping Neighbors of Unique Nodes (`v8` and `u5`):**\n    *   Neighbors of `v8` in G: `{v2 (deg 4), v3 (deg 2), v9 (deg 4)}`\n    *   Neighbors of `u5` in H: `{u2 (deg 4), u3 (deg 2), u9 (deg 4)}`\n    *   Since `f(v8) = u5`, their neighbors must correspond by degree.\n    *   This uniquely maps the degree-2 neighbor: `f(v3) = u3`.\n    *   The two degree-4 neighbors must map to each other: `{f(v2), f(v9)} = {u2, u9}`.\n\n*   **Distinguishing Ambiguous Degree-4 Nodes (`v2` vs `v9` and `u2` vs `u9`):**\n    Let's look at the neighbors of `v2` and `v9` and their degrees, excluding `v8`:\n    *   Neighbors of `v2` (excluding `v8`): `{v5 (deg 2), v6 (deg 2), v10 (deg 1)}`\n        `v2` has one neighbor of degree 1 (`v10`).\n    *   Neighbors of `v9` (excluding `v8`): `{v4 (deg 1), v6 (deg 2), v7 (deg 1)}`\n        `v9` has two neighbors of degree 1 (`v4`, `v7`).\n\n    Now compare with `u2` and `u9` (excluding `u5`):\n    *   Neighbors of `u2` (excluding `u5`): `{u0 (deg 2), u7 (deg 2), u8 (deg 1)}`\n        `u2` has one neighbor of degree 1 (`u8`).\n    *   Neighbors of `u9` (excluding `u5`): `{u6 (deg 1), u7 (deg 2), u11 (deg 1)}`\n        `u9` has two neighbors of degree 1 (`u6`, `u11`).\n\n    This allows us to uniquely map `v2` and `v9`:\n    *   `f(v2) = u2` (both have one degree-1 neighbor)\n    *   `f(v9) = u9` (both have two degree-1 neighbors)\n\n*   **Extending the Mapping:**\n    Now we can systematically extend the mapping based on adjacency:\n\n    1.  **From `f(v2) = u2`:**\n        *   `v2` is connected to `v10` (deg 1). `u2` is connected to `u8` (deg 1).\n            *   `f(v10) = u8`\n        *   `v2` is connected to `v5` (deg 2) and `v6` (deg 2). `u2` is connected to `u0` (deg 2) and `u7` (deg 2).\n            *   So, `{f(v5), f(v6)} = {u0, u7}`.\n\n    2.  **From `f(v9) = u9`:**\n        *   `v9` is connected to `v6` (deg 2). `u9` is connected to `u7` (deg 2).\n            *   This resolves the ambiguity from step 1: `f(v6) = u7`.\n            *   Therefore, the other mapping must be `f(v5) = u0`.\n        *   `v9` is connected to `v4` (deg 1) and `v7` (deg 1). `u9` is connected to `u6` (deg 1) and `u11` (deg 1).\n            *   So, `{f(v4), f(v7)} = {u6, u11}`. (The specific choice here doesn't affect isomorphism as `u6` and `u11` are structurally symmetric relative to `u9`.)\n            *   Let's arbitrarily choose `f(v4) = u6` and `f(v7) = u11`.\n\n    3.  **From `f(v3) = u3`:**\n        *   `v3` is connected to `v0` (deg 1). `u3` is connected to `u10` (deg 1).\n            *   `f(v0) = u10`\n\n    4.  **From `f(v5) = u0` (which we just mapped):**\n        *   `v5` is connected to `v11` (deg 1). `u0` is connected to `u1` (deg 1).\n            *   `f(v11) = u1`\n\n**Proposed Mapping Summary:**\n\n*   `f(v0) = u10` (deg 1)\n*   `f(v1) = u4` (deg 0)\n*   `f(v2) = u2` (deg 4)\n*   `f(v3) = u3` (deg 2)\n*   `f(v4) = u6` (deg 1)\n*   `f(v5) = u0` (deg 2)\n*   `f(v6) = u7` (deg 2)\n*   `f(v7) = u11` (deg 1)\n*   `f(v8) = u5` (deg 3)\n*   `f(v9) = u9` (deg 4)\n*   `f(v10) = u8` (deg 1)\n*   `f(v11) = u1` (deg 1)\n\n**3. Verification of Adjacency Preservation**\n\nWe must check that for every pair of vertices `(x, y)` in G, `(x, y)` is an edge in G if and only if `(f(x), f(y))` is an edge in H. Since both graphs have the same number of edges, we can verify all edges from G.\n\nEdges in G:\n1.  `(v0, v3)`: Is `(f(v0), f(v3))` = `(u10, u3)` an edge in H? Yes.\n2.  `(v2, v5)`: Is `(f(v2), f(v5))` = `(u2, u0)` an edge in H? Yes.\n3.  `(v2, v6)`: Is `(f(v2), f(v6))` = `(u2, u7)` an edge in H? Yes.\n4.  `(v2, v8)`: Is `(f(v2), f(v8))` = `(u2, u5)` an edge in H? Yes.\n5.  `(v2, v10)`: Is `(f(v2), f(v10))` = `(u2, u8)` an edge in H? Yes.\n6.  `(v3, v8)`: Is `(f(v3), f(v8))` = `(u3, u5)` an edge in H? Yes.\n7.  `(v4, v9)`: Is `(f(v4), f(v9))` = `(u6, u9)` an edge in H? Yes.\n8.  `(v5, v11)`: Is `(f(v5), f(v11))` = `(u0, u1)` an edge in H? Yes.\n9.  `(v6, v9)`: Is `(f(v6), f(v9))` = `(u7, u9)` an edge in H? Yes.\n10. `(v7, v9)`: Is `(f(v7), f(v9))` = `(u11, u9)` an edge in H? Yes.\n11. `(v8, v9)`: Is `(f(v8), f(v9))` = `(u5, u9)` an edge in H? Yes.\n\nAll 11 edges of G correspond to edges in H under the proposed mapping. This confirms that the adjacency relationships are preserved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince we successfully found a bijective mapping between the vertices of G and H that preserves their adjacency relationships, the two graphs are **isomorphic**.",

Edge (G7, G8) in G: $f(G7)=H8$, $f(G8)=H6$. (H8, H6) is an edge in H. (Verified)\n\nAll 5 edges in G are mapped to edges in H. Since both graphs have the same number of edges and vertices, and we found a bijection that preserves adjacency, the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, identical number of edges, identical degree sequences, and the existence of a bijection that preserves adjacency relationships, Graph G and Graph H are **isomorphic**.",

This also forms a P2 component.\n- `H_8` is connected to `H_12` (D3).\n- `H_10` is connected to `H_11` (D3).\n\nThis pattern matches. So, we must map the P2 components:\n`f({2, 3}) = {0, 1}`. Let's set `f(2) = 0` and `f(3) = 1`.\nFor the remaining D1 nodes, `f({1, 8})` must map to `H_D1_rem = {8, 10}`.\n\n**Step 3: Map Degree 3 Nodes (D3) by Neighbor Degree Pattern:**\nLet's examine the degree of neighbors for each D3 node:\nFor G:\n- `G_6`'s neighbors: `{1(D1), 7(D3), 12(D2)}` -> Pattern (D1, D2, D3)\n- `G_7`'s neighbors: `{6(D3), 10(D3), 13(D2)}` -> Pattern (D2, D3, D3)\n- `G_9`'s neighbors: `{5(D2), 12(D2), 14(D2)}` -> Pattern (D2, D2, D2)\n- `G_10`'s neighbors: `{7(D3), 8(D1), 11(D2)}` -> Pattern (D1, D2, D3)\n\nFor H:\n- `H_2`'s neighbors: `{6(D2), 7(D2), 13(D2)}` -> Pattern (D2, D2, D2)\n- `H_3`'s neighbors: `{9(D2), 11(D3), 12(D3)}` -> Pattern (D2, D3, D3)\n- `H_11`'s neighbors: `{3(D3), 7(D2), 10(D1)}` -> Pattern (D1, D2, D3)\n- `H_12`'s neighbors: `{3(D3), 8(D1), 14(D2)}` -> Pattern (D1, D2, D3)\n\nFrom this, we establish clear mappings for specific D3 nodes:\n- `f(9) = 2` (G_9 (D2,D2,D2) maps to H_2 (D2,D2,D2)).\n- `f(7) = 3` (G_7 (D2,D3,D3) maps to H_3 (D2,D3,D3)).\n- The remaining D3 nodes `G_6, G_10` (both D1,D2,D3) must map to `H_11, H_12` (both D1,D2,D3).\n\n**Step 4: Refine D1-D3 mappings and D2 implications:**\n\nLet's use the D3 mappings:\n- If `f(9) = 2`:\n  - `G_9`'s neighbors `{5(D2), 12(D2), 14(D2)}` must map to `H_2`'s neighbors `{6(D2), 7(D2), 13(D2)}`.\n  - So, `f({5, 12, 14}) = {6, 7, 13}`.\n\n- If `f(7) = 3`:\n  - `G_7`'s neighbors `{6(D3), 10(D3), 13(D2)}` must map to `H_3`'s neighbors `{9(D2), 11(D3), 12(D3)}`.\n  - This implies `f(13)` (D2) must map to `H_9` (D2). So, `f(13) = 9`.\n  - And `f({6, 10})` (D3) must map to `H_{11, 12}` (D3).\n\nNow consider the choice for `f(1)` and `f(8)` from Step 2:\n- `G_1` (D1) connected to `G_6` (D3). `G_8` (D1) connected to `G_10` (D3).\n- `H_8` (D1) connected to `H_12` (D3). `H_10` (D1) connected to `H_11` (D3).\n\nSince `f({6, 10}) = {11, 12}`:\n- If `f(6) = 11`, then `f(10) = 12`.\n  - This implies `f(1)` (neighbor of G6) must be `H_10` (neighbor of H11). So `f(1) = 10`.\n  - And `f(8)` (neighbor of G10) must be `H_8` (neighbor of H12). So `f(8) = 8`.\n  - This assignment `f(1)=10`, `f(6)=11`, `f(8)=8`, `f(10)=12` seems consistent with types.\n\nLet's consolidate the mapping so far:\n- `f(0) = 4`\n- `f(1) = 10`\n- `f(2) = 0`\n- `f(3) = 1`\n- `f(4) = 5`\n- `f(6) = 11`\n- `f(7) = 3`\n- `f(8) = 8`\n- `f(9) = 2`\n- `f(10) = 12`\n- `f(13) = 9`\n\nNow, let's derive the remaining D2 nodes from their connections to the mapped D3 nodes:\n- `G_6` (mapped to `H_11`) connects to `G_12` (D2). `H_11` connects to `H_7` (D2).\n  - So, `f(12) = 7`. (`deg_G(12)=2`, `deg_H(7)=2`. Consistent).\n- `G_10` (mapped to `H_12`) connects to `G_11` (D2). `H_12` connects to `H_14` (D2).\n  - So, `f(11) = 14`. (`deg_G(11)=2`, `deg_H(14)=2`. Consistent).\n\nRemaining unmapped nodes in G (all D2): `{5, 14}`\nRemaining unmapped nodes in H (all D2): `{6, 13}`\nSo `f({5, 14}) = {6, 13}`.\n\nLet's use the neighborhood structure of these remaining D2 nodes:\n- `G_5` (D2) connected to `{9(D3), 11(D2)}`.\n  - `f(5)` must be connected to `f(9)=2` and `f(11)=14`.\n  - In H, check neighbors of `H_2`: `{6, 7, 13}`.\n  - In H, check neighbors of `H_14`: `{12, 13}`.\n  - The common neighbor of `H_2` and `H_14` is `H_13`.\n  - Therefore, `f(5)` must be `13`. (`deg_G(5)=2`, `deg_H(13)=2`. Consistent).\n\n- If `f(5) = 13`, then the only remaining mapping for `G_14` is `H_6`.\n  - So, `f(14) = 6`. (`deg_G(14)=2`, `deg_H(6)=2`. Consistent).\n\n**Complete Candidate Mapping f:**\n- `f(0) = 4`\n- `f(1) = 10`\n- `f(2) = 0`\n- `f(3) = 1`\n- `f(4) = 5`\n- `f(5) = 13`\n- `f(6) = 11`\n- `f(7) = 3`\n- `f(8) = 8`\n- `f(9) = 2`\n- `f(10) = 12`\n- `f(11) = 14`\n- `f(12) = 7`\n- `f(13) = 9`\n- `f(14) = 6`\n\nThis mapping is a bijection, and all nodes map to nodes of the same degree.\n\n**3. Verification of Adjacencies:**\nNow, we must verify that for every edge `(u, v)` in G, `(f(u), f(v))` is an edge in H. Since the number of edges is the same, this is a sufficient condition.\n\nEdges in G:\n1. `(1, 6)`: `G[1][6]=1`. Check `H[f(1)][f(6)] = H[10][11]`. `H[10][11]=1`. (OK)\n2. `(2, 3)`: `G[2][3]=1`.

(2 vertices, a K2 graph)\n            *   Degrees within this component: deg(5)=1, deg(9)=1. Sorted: [1, 1].\n    *   **H's structure:** 4 isolated vertices, one 7-vertex component, one 2-vertex component.\n\nThe component structures match perfectly. The isolated vertices are trivially isomorphic to each other. The 2-vertex components (a single edge) are also trivially isomorphic. The core of the problem is to find an isomorphism between the two 7-vertex components.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a Vertex Mapping for the 7-Vertex Components**\n\nLet G_comp1 = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12} and H_comp1 = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}.\nBoth components have a unique vertex with degree 3:\n*   In G_comp1: vertex 1 (deg 3). Neighbors: {5, 6, 12} with degrees {1, 1, 2}.\n*   In H_comp1: vertex 2 (deg 3). Neighbors: {0, 6, 7} with degrees {1, 1, 2}.\n\nThis suggests the mapping: `f(1) = 2`.\n\nNow map their neighbors based on degrees:\n*   Neighbors of G_1 (5, 6, 12) must map to neighbors of H_2 (0, 6, 7).\n*   G_5 (deg 1) and G_6 (deg 1) can map to H_0 (deg 1) and H_6 (deg 1).\n*   G_12 (deg 2) must map to H_7 (deg 2).\n    *   Let's try: `f(12) = 7`.\n    *   Then, we can map: `f(5) = 0` and `f(6) = 6` (or vice versa for 0 and 6).\n\nNow, let's follow the connections of `f(12)=7`.\n*   G_12 is connected to G_1 and G_0. We already mapped `f(1)=2`.\n*   H_7 is connected to H_2 and H_3. Since `f(12)` maps to `H_7` and `f(1)` maps to `H_2`, this implies that G_0 must map to H_3 to preserve the adjacency of (G_12, G_0).\n    *   So, `f(0) = 3`.\n\nNext, consider the connections of `f(0)=3`.\n*   G_0 is connected to G_3 and G_12. We already mapped `f(12)=7`.\n*   H_3 is connected to H_4 and H_7. Since `f(0)` maps to `H_3` and `f(12)` maps to `H_7`, this implies that G_3 must map to H_4.\n    *   So, `f(3) = 4`.\n\nFinally, consider the connections of `f(3)=4`.\n*   G_3 is connected to G_0 and G_8. We already mapped `f(0)=3`.\n*   H_4 is connected to H_3 and H_8. Since `f(3)` maps to `H_4` and `f(0)` maps to `H_3`, this implies that G_8 must map to H_8.\n    *   So, `f(8) = 8`.\n\nAll vertices in G_comp1 have been mapped to H_comp1.\nThe proposed mapping for the 7-vertex component is:\n*   f(0) = 3\n*   f(1) = 2\n*   f(3) = 4\n*   f(5) = 0\n*   f(6) = 6\n*   f(8) = 8\n*   f(12) = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Mapping for All Edges**\n\nLet's check every edge in G's 7-vertex component using the proposed mapping:\n1.  Edge (0, 3) in G: Does (f(0), f(3)) = (3, 4) exist in H? Yes, H[3][4]=1. (OK)\n2.  Edge (0, 12) in G: Does (f(0), f(12)) = (3, 7) exist in H? Yes, H[3][7]=1. (OK)\n3.  Edge (1, 5) in G: Does (f(1), f(5)) = (2, 0) exist in H? Yes, H[2][0]=1. (OK)\n4.  Edge (1, 6) in G: Does (f(1), f(6)) = (2, 6) exist in H? Yes, H[2][6]=1. (OK)\n5.  Edge (1, 12) in G: Does (f(1), f(12)) = (2, 7) exist in H? Yes, H[2][7]=1. (OK)\n6.  Edge (3, 8) in G: Does (f(3), f(8)) = (4, 8) exist in H? Yes, H[4][8]=1. (OK)\n\nAll edges in G's 7-vertex component are preserved in H's 7-vertex component. This component is isomorphic.\n\n**Step 5: Complete the Full Isomorphism Mapping**\n\n*   **7-vertex component mapping:**\n    *   f(0) = 3\n    *   f(1) = 2\n    *   f(3) = 4\n    *   f(5) = 0\n    *   f(6) = 6\n    *   f(8) = 8\n    *   f(12) = 7\n*   **2-vertex component mapping (G: {7,9}, H: {5,9}):**\n    *   f(7) = 5\n    *   f(9) = 9\n    (Edge (7,9) in G maps to (5,9) in H; H[5][9]=1. OK)\n*   **Isolated vertices mapping (G: {2,4,10,11}, H: {1,10,11,12}):**\n    *   f(2) = 1\n    *   f(4) = 10\n    *   f(10) = 11\n    *   f(11) = 12\n    (Any one-to-one mapping works for isolated vertices)\n\n**Summary of the complete isomorphism mapping:**\nf(0) -> 3\nf(1) -> 2\nf(2) -> 1\nf(3) -> 4\nf(4) -> 10\nf(5) -> 0\nf(6) -> 6\nf(7) -> 5\nf(8) -> 8\nf(9) -> 9\nf(10) -> 11\nf(11) -> 12\nf(12) -> 7\n\nSince we have found a bijection between the vertices of G and H that preserves all adjacency relationships, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

For an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric, so summing rows or columns gives the degree.\n\n**Graph G Adjacency Matrix and Degrees:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 0: Degree = 1 (connected to 5)\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],  # Vertex 1: Degree = 3 (connected to 3, 7, 8)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Vertex 2: Degree = 1 (connected to 8)\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 3: Degree = 1 (connected to 1)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],  # Vertex 4: Degree = 2 (connected to 9, 10)\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 5: Degree = 1 (connected to 0)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 6: Degree = 1 (connected to 7)\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 7: Degree = 2 (connected to 1, 6)\n [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 8: Degree = 2 (connected to 1, 2)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 9: Degree = 1 (connected to 4)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] # Vertex 10: Degree = 1 (connected to 4)\n```\n**Degrees of G:**\n*   Deg(0) = 1\n*   Deg(1) = 3\n*   Deg(2) = 1\n*   Deg(3) = 1\n*   Deg(4) = 2\n*   Deg(5) = 1\n*   Deg(6) = 1\n*   Deg(7) = 2\n*   Deg(8) = 2\n*   Deg(9) = 1\n*   Deg(10) = 1\n\n**Degree Sequence of G (sorted in descending order):** [3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n**Counts for G:**\n*   Degree 3: 1 vertex\n*   Degree 2: 3 vertices\n*   Degree 1: 7 vertices\n*   Degree 0: 0 vertices\n\n---\n\n**Graph H Adjacency Matrix and Degrees:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Vertex 0: Degree = 2 (connected to 2, 10)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Vertex 1: Degree = 1 (connected to 10)\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 2: Degree = 1 (connected to 0)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Vertex 3: Degree = 1 (connected to 8)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Vertex 4: Degree = 2 (connected to 6, 8)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 5: Degree = 0 (isolated)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 6: Degree = 2 (connected to 4, 7)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Vertex 7: Degree = 2 (connected to 6, 10)\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 8: Degree = 2 (connected to 3, 4)\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Vertex 9: Degree = 0 (isolated)\n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]] # Vertex 10: Degree = 3 (connected to 0, 1, 7)\n```\n**Degrees of H:**\n*   Deg(0) = 2\n*   Deg(1) = 1\n*   Deg(2) = 1\n*   Deg(3) = 1\n*   Deg(4) = 2\n*   Deg(5) = 0\n*   Deg(6) = 2\n*   Deg(7) = 2\n*   Deg(8) = 2\n*   Deg(9) = 0\n*   Deg(10) = 3\n\n**Degree Sequence of H (sorted in descending order):** [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n**Counts for H:**\n*   Degree 3: 1 vertex\n*   Degree 2: 5 vertices\n*   Degree 1: 3 vertices\n*   Degree 0: 2 vertices\n\n### Step 3: Compare Degree Sequences\n\n*   **Degree Sequence G:** [3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    *   Count of degree 3: 1\n    *   Count of degree 2: 3\n    *   Count of degree 1: 7\n    *   Count of degree 0: 0\n\n*   **Degree Sequence H:** [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n    *   Count of degree 3: 1\n    *   Count of degree 2: 5\n    *   Count of degree 1: 3\n    *   Count of degree 0: 2\n\nThe degree sequences of G and H are different. For example, Graph G has 3 vertices of degree 2, while Graph H has 5 vertices of degree 2. Also, Graph G has 7 vertices of degree 1 and no isolated vertices (degree 0), whereas Graph H has 3 vertices of degree 1 and 2 isolated vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Edges (M)\n\nThe sum of degrees in any graph is twice the number of edges.\n*   **For G:** Sum of degrees = 1+3+1+1+2+1+1+2+2+1+1 = 16. M_G = 16 / 2 = 8 edges.\n*   **For H:** Sum of degrees = 2+1+1+1+2+0+2+2+2+0+3 = 16. M_H = 16 / 2 = 8 edges.\n\n**Result:** M_G = M_H. This invariant matches.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile both graphs have the same number of vertices (11) and edges (8), their degree sequences are different. A fundamental property of isomorphic graphs is that they must have identical degree sequences (i.e., the same number of vertices for each possible degree). Since the degree sequences of G and H do not match, the graphs cannot be isomorphic.\n\n**Final Answer:** The two graphs are **not isomorphic**.",

Check H[3,10]: Yes.\n\n    All 13 edges in G have a corresponding edge in H under the mapping P. Since the number of edges is the same and the mapping is a bijection, this confirms that the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

      "model_response": "To determine if two graphs, G and H, are isomorphic, we must check if there exists a one-to-one mapping between their vertices that preserves adjacency. A common first step is to compare graph invariants. If any invariant differs, the graphs cannot be isomorphic.\n\nHere's a systematic analysis:\n\n**1. Number of Vertices (n):**\n*   Graph G's adjacency matrix is 13x13, so it has 13 vertices.\n*   Graph H's adjacency matrix is 13x13, so it has 13 vertices.\n*   `n_G = n_H = 13`. (Match)\n\n**2. Number of Edges (m):**\nFor an undirected graph, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees of all vertices (or half the number of '1's in the adjacency matrix).\n\n*   **Graph G:**\n    Let's calculate the degree of each vertex in G by summing the '1's in each row (or column):\n    *   deg(v0) = 1 (to v4)\n    *   deg(v1) = 4 (to v2, v3, v5, v10)\n    *   deg(v2) = 2 (to v1, v9)\n    *   deg(v3) = 2 (to v1, v5)\n    *   deg(v4) = 3 (to v0, v5, v11)\n    *   deg(v5) = 3 (to v1, v3, v4)\n    *   deg(v6) = 0\n    *   deg(v7) = 1 (to v8)\n    *   deg(v8) = 2 (to v7, v11)\n    *   deg(v9) = 2 (to v2, v12)\n    *   deg(v10) = 1 (to v1)\n    *   deg(v11) = 2 (to v4, v8)\n    *   deg(v12) = 1 (to v9)\n    Sum of degrees for G = 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 24.\n    Number of edges `m_G = 24 / 2 = 12`.\n\n*   **Graph H:**\n    Let's calculate the degree of each vertex in H:\n    *   deg(v0) = 1 (to v3)\n    *   deg(v1) = 2 (to v5, v7)\n    *   deg(v2) = 3 (to v3, v9, v10)\n    *   deg(v3) = 4 (to v0, v2, v4, v12)\n    *   deg(v4) = 1 (to v3)\n    *   deg(v5) = 3 (to v1, v9, v12)\n    *   deg(v6) = 0\n    *   deg(v7) = 2 (to v1, v12)\n    *   deg(v8) = 1 (to v11)\n    *   deg(v9) = 2 (to v2, v5)\n    *   deg(v10) = 1 (to v2)\n    *   deg(v11) = 1 (to v8)\n    *   deg(v12) = 3 (to v3, v5, v7)\n    Sum of degrees for H = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 24.\n    Number of edges `m_H = 24 / 2 = 12`.

If two graphs are isomorphic, their degree sequences must be identical.\n\n*   **Degree sequence of G:**\n    Sorted degrees: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]\n    Counts of degrees in G:\n    *   Degree 0: 1 vertex (v6)\n    *   Degree 1: 4 vertices (v0, v7, v10, v12)\n    *   Degree 2: 5 vertices (v2, v3, v8, v9, v11)\n    *   Degree 3: 2 vertices (v4, v5)\n    *   Degree 4: 1 vertex (v1)\n\n*   **Degree sequence of H:**\n    Sorted degrees: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n    Counts of degrees in H:\n    *   Degree 0: 1 vertex (v6)\n    *   Degree 1: 5 vertices (v0, v4, v8, v10, v11)\n    *   Degree 2: 3 vertices (v1, v7, v9)\n    *   Degree 3: 3 vertices (v2, v5, v12)\n    *   Degree 4: 1 vertex (v3)\n\n**Comparison:**\nLet's compare the counts of vertices for each degree:\n| Degree | Count in G | Count in H | Match? |\n| :----- | :--------- | :--------- | :----- |\n| 0      | 1          | 1          | Yes    |\n| 1      | 4          | 5          | No     |\n| 2      | 5          | 3          | No     |\n| 3      | 2          | 3          | No     |\n| 4      | 1          | 1          | Yes    |\n\nThe degree sequences of G and H are different. For example, Graph G has 5 vertices of degree 2, while Graph H has only 3 vertices of degree 2. Since the degree sequence is a fundamental graph invariant, if the degree sequences are not identical, the graphs cannot be isomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the differing degree sequences, Graph G and Graph H are not isomorphic.",

The nodes connected to `H2` are `H1` and `H7`.\n    Let's map:\n    *   `f(G1) = H1`\n    *   `f(G8) = H7`\n\n    Since `G7` is connected to `G4` and `G6`, their images `f(G4)` and `f(G6)` must be connected to `f(G7)` (which is `H6`). The nodes connected to `H6` are `H5` and `H8`.\n    Let's map:\n    *   `f(G4) = H5`\n    *   `f(G6) = H8`\n\n**Proposed Mapping:**\n*   `f(G0) = H2`\n*   `f(G1) = H1`\n*   `f(G2) = H0`\n*   `f(G3) = H3`\n*   `f(G4) = H5`\n*   `f(G5) = H4`\n*   `f(G6) = H8`\n*   `f(G7) = H6`\n*   `f(G8) = H7`\n\n**Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\n\nWe check if an edge $(u, v)$ exists in G if and only if an edge $(f(u), f(v))$ exists in H.\n\n1.  Edge (G0, G1) in G: Is (f(G0), f(G1)) = (H2, H1) an edge in H? Yes. (H adjacency matrix H[2][1]=1)\n2.  Edge (G0, G8) in G: Is (f(G0), f(G8)) = (H2, H7) an edge in H? Yes. (H adjacency matrix H[2][7]=1)\n3.  Edge (G4, G7) in G: Is (f(G4), f(G7)) = (H5, H6) an edge in H? Yes. (H adjacency matrix H[5][6]=1)\n4.  Edge (G6, G7) in G: Is (f(G6), f(G7)) = (H8, H6) an edge in H? Yes. (H adjacency matrix H[8][6]=1)\n\nAll 4 edges in G map to existing edges in H. Since both graphs have 4 edges, this mapping also ensures that non-edges in G map to non-edges in H. For example, G2 is isolated, f(G2)=H0 is also isolated. G0 is not connected to G2, f(G0)=H2 is not connected to f(G2)=H0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the matching structure of their connected components (two $P_3$ graphs and three $P_1$ graphs for both), and the successful construction of an adjacency-preserving bijection, we can conclude that Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Final Answer:** Yes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

Detailed Structural Analysis and Mapping:**\n\nWe can categorize nodes further based on the degrees of their neighbors.\n\n**Graph G:**\n- **Isolated nodes (degree 0):** {3, 5}\n- **Degree 1 nodes:** {0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 12}\n- **Degree 2 nodes:** {2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14}\n    - N(2) = {7 (deg 2), 12 (deg 1)}  -> (deg 1, deg 2) type\n    - N(4) = {1 (deg 1), 6 (deg 1)}   -> (deg 1, deg 1) type\n    - N(7) = {2 (deg 2), 13 (deg 2)}  -> (deg 2, deg 2) type\n    - N(8) = {9 (deg 1), 11 (deg 2)}  -> (deg 1, deg 2) type\n    - N(11) = {8 (deg 2), 13 (deg 2)} -> (deg 2, deg 2) type\n    - N(13) = {7 (deg 2), 11 (deg 2)} -> (deg 2, deg 2) type\n    - N(14) = {0 (deg 1), 10 (deg 1)} -> (deg 1, deg 1) type\n\nSummary for G's Degree-2 nodes:\n- Two nodes (4, 14) have two degree-1 neighbors.\n- Two nodes (2, 8) have one degree-1 and one degree-2 neighbor.\n- Three nodes (7, 11, 13) have two degree-2 neighbors.

Let's build a one-to-one mapping (bijection) $\\phi: V_G \\to V_H$.\n\n**Constructing the Isomorphism Mapping $\\phi$:**\n\n1.  **Map Isolated Nodes (Degree 0):**\n    *   $\\phi(3_G) = 3_H$\n    *   $\\phi(5_G) = 13_H$\n\n2.  **Map Degree-2 Nodes with Two Degree-1 Neighbors:**\n    *   Let's map $\\phi(4_G) = 0_H$ (both connect to two deg-1 nodes).\n        *   $N(4_G) = \\{1_G, 6_G\\}$. $N(0_H) = \\{7_H, 8_H\\}$.\n        *   This implies $\\phi(\\{1_G, 6_G\\}) = \\{7_H, 8_H\\}$. Let's assign:\n            *   $\\phi(1_G) = 7_H$\n            *   $\\phi(6_G) = 8_H$\n    *   Let's map $\\phi(14_G) = 14_H$ (the other pair of (deg 1, deg 1) type deg-2 nodes).\n        *   $N(14_G) = \\{0_G, 10_G\\}$. $N(14_H) = \\{1_H, 2_H\\}$.\n        *   This implies $\\phi(\\{0_G, 10_G\\}) = \\{1_H, 2_H\\}$. Let's assign:\n            *   $\\phi(0_G) = 1_H$\n            *   $\\phi(10_G) = 2_H$\n\n3.  **Map Degree-2 Nodes with One Degree-1 and One Degree-2 Neighbor:**\n    *   G has $2_G, 8_G$ of this type. H has $9_H, 12_H$ of this type.\n    *   $N(2_G) = \\{7_G (\\text{deg 2}), 12_G (\\text{deg 1})\\}$\n    *   $N(8_G) = \\{9_G (\\text{deg 1}), 11_G (\\text{deg 2})\\}$\n    *   Remaining deg 1 nodes in G: $\\{9_G, 12_G\\}$.\n    *   Remaining deg 1 nodes in H: $\\{4_H, 6_H\\}$.\n    *   $\\phi(12_G)$ must map to a remaining deg 1 node in H. Let's try:\n        *   $\\phi(12_G) = 6_H$ (conn. to $2_G$ in G; $6_H$ conn. to $12_H$ in H).\n        *   This suggests $\\phi(2_G) = 12_H$.\n    *   Similarly, for $9_G$:\n        *   $\\phi(9_G) = 4_H$ (conn. to $8_G$ in G; $4_H$ conn. to $9_H$ in H).\n        *   This suggests $\\phi(8_G) = 9_H$.\n\n4.  **Map Degree-2 Nodes with Two Degree-2 Neighbors (The 3-cycles):**\n    *   G has $\\{7_G, 11_G, 13_G\\}$ forming a $C_3$.\n    *   H has $\\{5_H, 10_H, 11_H\\}$ forming a $C_3$.\n    *   Let's use the connections established:\n        *   $N(7_G) = \\{2_G, 13_G\\}$. Since $\\phi(2_G) = 12_H$, $\\phi(7_G)$ must be connected to $12_H$. In H, $5_H$ is connected to $12_H$.\n            *   $\\phi(7_G) = 5_H$. This implies $\\phi(13_G)$ must be the other neighbor of $5_H$ in H, which is $10_H$.\n                *   So, $\\phi(13_G) = 10_H$.\n        *   $N(11_G) = \\{8_G, 13_G\\}$. Since $\\phi(8_G) = 9_H$ and we proposed $\\phi(13_G) = 10_H$, $\\phi(11_G)$ must be connected to $9_H$ and $10_H$. In H, $11_H$ is connected to $9_H$ and $10_H$.\n            *   $\\phi(11_G) = 11_H$.\n\n**Final Proposed Mapping $\\phi$:**\n\n*   $\\phi(3_G) = 3_H$\n*   $\\phi(5_G) = 13_H$\n*   $\\phi(4_G) = 0_H$\n*   $\\phi(14_G) = 14_H$\n*   $\\phi(1_G) = 7_H$\n*   $\\phi(6_G) = 8_H$\n*   $\\phi(0_G) = 1_H$\n*   $\\phi(10_G) = 2_H$\n*   $\\phi(12_G) = 6_H$\n*   $\\phi(9_G) = 4_H$\n*   $\\phi(2_G) = 12_H$\n*   $\\phi(8_G) = 9_H$\n*   $\\phi(7_G) = 5_H$\n*   $\\phi(13_G) = 10_H$\n*   $\\phi(11_G) = 11_H$\n\n**3. Verify Adjacencies (Crucial Step):**\n\nWe must check if for every edge $(u, v)$ in G, $(\\phi(u), \\phi(v))$ is an edge in H, and vice-versa. Given that we built the mapping by matching neighbor properties, a full check confirms the mapping:\n\n*   $(0_G, 14_G) \\to (\\phi(0_G), \\phi(14_G)) = (1_H, 14_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(1_G, 4_G) \\to (\\phi(1_G), \\phi(4_G)) = (7_H, 0_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(2_G, 7_G) \\to (\\phi(2_G), \\phi(7_G)) = (12_H, 5_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(2_G, 12_G) \\to (\\phi(2_G), \\phi(12_G)) = (12_H, 6_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(4_G, 6_G) \\to (\\phi(4_G), \\phi(6_G)) = (0_H, 8_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(7_G, 13_G) \\to (\\phi(7_G), \\phi(13_G)) = (5_H, 10_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(8_G, 9_G) \\to (\\phi(8_G), \\phi(9_G)) = (9_H, 4_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(8_G, 11_G) \\to (\\phi(8_G), \\phi(11_G)) = (9_H, 11_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(10_G, 14_G) \\to (\\phi(10_G), \\phi(14_G)) = (2_H, 14_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n*   $(11_G, 13_G) \\to (\\phi(11_G), \\phi(13_G)) = (11_H, 10_H)$ (Edge in H) - Yes\n\nAll edges in G are preserved in H under the mapping $\\phi$. Since the mapping is a bijection and preserves adjacency, the graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$",

Is (H0, H6) an edge in H? Yes.\n*   Edge (G2, G3) in G: $f(G_2) = H_1$, $f(G_3) = H_3$. Is (H1, H3) an edge in H? Yes.\n*   Edge (G2, G8) in G: $f(G_2) = H_1$, $f(G_8) = H_4$. Is (H1, H4) an edge in H? Yes.\n\nAll edges in G map to edges in H. Also, the mapping ensures that non-edges in G map to non-edges in H (e.g., an isolated node in G maps to an isolated node in H, and end-nodes of paths map to end-nodes of paths, etc.).\n\nSince a bijection exists between the vertices of G and H that preserves adjacency, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$",

Cycle lengths (e.g., girth, shortest cycle)\n6.  Eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix (more complex)\n\nLet's analyze Graph G and Graph H using the first three invariants, as they are usually the quickest to check.\n\n**Graph G Adjacency Matrix:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Graph H Adjacency Matrix:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n### 1. Number of Vertices (n)\n\n*   Both adjacency matrices are 10x10.\n*   **Graph G:** `n_G = 10`\n*   **Graph H:** `n_H = 10`\n*   **Match.**\n\n### 2. Number of Edges (m)\n\nFor an undirected graph, the number of edges is half the sum of all degrees (or half the sum of all 1s in the adjacency matrix). We first verify that both matrices are symmetric (A[i][j] = A[j][i]), indicating undirected graphs. A quick check confirms this for both G and H.\n\n**For Graph G:**\nWe calculate the degree of each vertex (sum of 1s in each row):\n*   `deg(0) = 4` (connected to 4, 6, 7, 9)\n*   `deg(1) = 0`\n*   `deg(2) = 1` (connected to 4)\n*   `deg(3) = 0`\n*   `deg(4) = 2` (connected to 0, 2)\n*   `deg(5) = 1` (connected to 6)\n*   `deg(6) = 2` (connected to 0, 5)\n*   `deg(7) = 1` (connected to 0)\n*   `deg(8) = 0`\n*   `deg(9) = 1` (connected to 0)\n\nSum of degrees for G = 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 12\nNumber of edges `m_G = 12 / 2 = 6`.\n\n**For Graph H:**\nWe calculate the degree of each vertex:\n*   `deg(0) = 2` (connected to 5, 8)\n*   `deg(1) = 0`\n*   `deg(2) = 0`\n*   `deg(3) = 3` (connected to 7, 8, 9)\n*   `deg(4) = 0`\n*   `deg(5) = 1` (connected to 0)\n*   `deg(6) = 1` (connected to 9)\n*   `deg(7) = 1` (connected to 3)\n*   `deg(8) = 2` (connected to 0, 3)\n*   `deg(9) = 2` (connected to 3, 6)\n\nSum of degrees for H = 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 12\nNumber of edges `m_H = 12 / 2 = 6`.\n\n*   `m_G = 6` and `m_H = 6`.\n*   **Match.**\n\n### 3. Degree Sequence\n\nThe degree sequence is the list of vertex degrees, sorted in non-increasing (or non-decreasing) order.\n\n**For Graph G:**\nDegrees: [4, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nSorted Degree Sequence: `[4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n**For Graph H:**\nDegrees: [2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nSorted Degree Sequence: `[3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nComparing the sorted degree sequences:\n*   Graph G: `[4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Graph H: `[3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nThe degree sequences are different. Graph G has one vertex of degree 4, while Graph H has one vertex of degree 3. This difference alone is sufficient to conclude that the graphs are not isomorphic. If graphs are isomorphic, their degree sequences must be identical.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the degree sequences of Graph G and Graph H are not identical, the two graphs are **not isomorphic**.",

This strong structural similarity indicates they are likely isomorphic.\n\n5.  **Construct an Isomorphism (Bijection):**\n    We can define a mapping `f: V(G) -> V(H)` that preserves adjacency based on the structural roles of the vertices:\n\n    *   **Map Isolated Vertices:**\n        `f(v0) = u1`\n        `f(v3) = u3`\n        `f(v5) = u5`\n        `f(v6) = u6`\n        (Any permutation of these mappings for isolated vertices would also work).\n\n    *   **Map the P2 Component:**\n        The P2 component in G is (v7, v8). The P2 component in H is (u0, u8).\n        `f(v7) = u0`\n        `f(v8) = u8`\n        (Alternatively, `f(v7)=u8` and `f(v8)=u0`).\n\n    *   **Map the P3 Component:**\n        The central vertex (degree 2) in G's P3 is v4. The central vertex (degree 2) in H's P3 is u4.\n        `f(v4) = u4`\n        The end vertices (degree 1) in G's P3 are v1 and v2. The end vertices (degree 1) in H's P3 are u2 and u7.\n        `f(v1) = u2`\n        `f(v2) = u7`\n        (Alternatively, `f(v1)=u7` and `f(v2)=u2`).\n\n    Let's verify this proposed mapping `f`:\n    *   `f(v0)=u1`, `f(v1)=u2`, `f(v2)=u7`, `f(v3)=u3`, `f(v4)=u4`, `f(v5)=u5`, `f(v6)=u6`, `f(v7)=u0`, `f(v8)=u8`.\n\n    Check adjacency preservation for all edges in G:\n    *   Edge (v1, v4) in G: Is (f(v1), f(v4)) = (u2, u4) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (v2, v4) in G: Is (f(v2), f(v4)) = (u7, u4) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (v7, v8) in G: Is (f(v7), f(v8)) = (u0, u8) an edge in H? Yes.\n\n    All edges and non-edges (including the isolated vertices) are preserved under this mapping.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the same composition of connected components, we were able to construct a bijection that preserves adjacency. Therefore, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the two graphs are isomorphic.",

(Yes, H[5][1]=1)\n        *   (1,7) in G $\\rightarrow$ (f(1), f(7)) = (5,6) in H. (Yes, H[5][6]=1)\n        *   (2,4) in G $\\rightarrow$ (f(2), f(4)) = (2,8) in H. (Yes, H[2][8]=1)\n        *   (4,2) in G $\\rightarrow$ (f(4), f(2)) = (8,2) in H. (Yes, H[8][2]=1)\n        *   (6,1) in G $\\rightarrow$ (f(6), f(1)) = (1,5) in H. (Yes, H[1][5]=1)\n        *   (7,1) in G $\\rightarrow$ (f(7), f(1)) = (6,5) in H. (Yes, H[6][5]=1)\n\n    All 6 edges in G successfully map to edges in H. Since the total number of edges is the same for both graphs, this implies that non-edges in G also map to non-edges in H.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll necessary conditions for isomorphism (same number of vertices, same number of edges, identical degree sequences, and matching component structures) are met. Furthermore, we have successfully constructed a bijective mapping between the vertices of G and H that perfectly preserves adjacency relationships.\n\nTherefore, the two graphs G and H are **isomorphic**.",

The overall structure is identical.\n\nSince all fundamental graph invariants (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence, and structure of connected components) match, the graphs are isomorphic. We can demonstrate an isomorphism by providing a mapping `f: V_G -> V_H`:\n\nOne possible mapping:\n*   Map edge (0,11) in G to edge (0,7) in H:\n    *   `f(0) = 0`\n    *   `f(11) = 7`\n*   Map edge (1,2) in G to edge (1,11) in H:\n    *   `f(1) = 1`\n    *   `f(2) = 11`\n*   Map edge (5,8) in G to edge (3,10) in H:\n    *   `f(5) = 3`\n    *   `f(8) = 10`\n*   Map the isolated vertices in G to the isolated vertices in H (any permutation works here):\n    *   Isolated in G: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10}\n    *   Isolated in H: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}\n    *   `f(3) = 2`\n    *   `f(4) = 4`\n    *   `f(6) = 5`\n    *   `f(7) = 6`\n    *   `f(9) = 8`\n    *   `f(10) = 9`\n\nThis mapping `f` is a bijection and preserves adjacency, thus confirming that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

This is not an edge. Its image (f(1), f(0)) = (0, 1) in H. This is also not an edge in H.

(Pass)**\n\n*   **Number of Edges ($m$):**\n    We can count the edges by summing the degrees of all vertices and dividing by 2 (since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices).\n\n    **Graph G:**\n    Let's calculate the degree of each vertex in G:\n    *   deg(G0) = 1 (connected to G5)\n    *   deg(G1) = 2 (connected to G2, G5)\n    *   deg(G2) = 2 (connected to G1, G4)\n    *   deg(G3) = 0 (isolated)\n    *   deg(G4) = 2 (connected to G2, G5)\n    *   deg(G5) = 4 (connected to G0, G1, G4, G6)\n    *   deg(G6) = 2 (connected to G5, G7)\n    *   deg(G7) = 1 (connected to G6)\n    Sum of degrees in G = 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 14\n    Number of edges $m_G = 14 / 2 = 7$.\n\n    **Graph H:**\n    Let's calculate the degree of each vertex in H:\n    *   deg(H0) = 3 (connected to H1, H2, H3)\n    *   deg(H1) = 2 (connected to H0, H2)\n    *   deg(H2) = 2 (connected to H0, H1)\n    *   deg(H3) = 3 (connected to H0, H6, H7)\n    *   deg(H4) = 1 (connected to H7)\n    *   deg(H5) = 0 (isolated)\n    *   deg(H6) = 1 (connected to H3)\n    *   deg(H7) = 2 (connected to H3, H4)\n    Sum of degrees in H = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 14\n    Number of edges $m_H = 14 / 2 = 7$.\n    *   **Result: $m_G = m_H = 7$.

Specifically, Graph G contains a vertex with degree 4 (G5), while the maximum degree of any vertex in Graph H is 3 (H0 and H3). For an isomorphism to exist, there would need to be a one-to-one mapping of vertices that preserves degrees. As Graph H does not have any vertex of degree 4, no such mapping is possible.\n\nTherefore, Graph G and Graph H are **not isomorphic**.",

So, $\\phi(G12) = H11$.\n        *   The two degree-3 neighbors of G12 are G6 and G9. Their images must be H6 and H13 (the degree-3 neighbors of H11). We can map them arbitrarily, e.g.:\n            *   $\\phi(G6) = H6$\n            *   $\\phi(G9) = H13$\n        (This also ensures that the edge (G6, G9) is mapped to (H6, H13), as both are part of their respective C3s).\n\n    2.  **Branches from the C3 vertices:**\n        *   **Branch from G6:** G6 connects to G2 (deg 3). G2 connects to G8 (deg 1) and G10 (deg 1).\n            *   Since $\\phi(G6) = H6$, G2's image must be H4 (the remaining neighbor of H6). So, $\\phi(G2) = H4$.\n            *   G8 and G10 are pendant to G2. Their images must be H1 and H5 (pendant to H4). So, we can map:\n                *   $\\phi(G8) = H1$\n                *   $\\phi(G10) = H5$\n                (Or vice versa for G8 and G10).\n\n        *   **Branch from G9:** G9 connects to G3 (deg 3). G3 connects to G1 (deg 1) and G14 (deg 1).\n            *   Since $\\phi(G9) = H13$, G3's image must be H14 (the remaining neighbor of H13). So, $\\phi(G3) = H14$.\n            *   G1 and G14 are pendant to G3. Their images must be H0 and H7 (pendant to H14). So, we can map:\n                *   $\\phi(G1) = H0$\n                *   $\\phi(G14) = H7$\n                (Or vice versa for G1 and G14).\n\n**Final Proposed Isomorphism Mapping $\\phi$:**\n\n*   $\\phi(G0) = H2$\n*   $\\phi(G1) = H0$\n*   $\\phi(G2) = H4$\n*   $\\phi(G3) = H14$\n*   $\\phi(G4) = H12$\n*   $\\phi(G5) = H3$\n*   $\\phi(G6) = H6$\n*   $\\phi(G7) = H8$\n*   $\\phi(G8) = H1$\n*   $\\phi(G9) = H13$\n*   $\\phi(G10) = H5$\n*   $\\phi(G11) = H9$\n*   $\\phi(G12) = H11$\n*   $\\phi(G13) = H10$\n*   $\\phi(G14) = H7$\n\n**Verification:**\nWe must ensure that for every pair of vertices (u, v) in G, (u, v) is an edge in G if and only if ($\\phi$(u), $\\phi$(v)) is an edge in H. Since we matched degrees and built the mapping based on adjacency, this should hold. Let's check all 10 edges of G:\n\n1.  (G0, G4) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G0)=H2, \\phi(G4)=H12$. (H2, H12) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n2.  (G1, G3) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G1)=H0, \\phi(G3)=H14$. (H0, H14) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n3.  (G2, G6) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G2)=H4, \\phi(G6)=H6$. (H4, H6) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n4.  (G2, G8) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G2)=H4, \\phi(G8)=H1$. (H4, H1) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n5.  (G2, G10) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G2)=H4, \\phi(G10)=H5$. (H4, H5) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n6.  (G3, G9) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G3)=H14, \\phi(G9)=H13$. (H14, H13) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n7.  (G3, G14) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G3)=H14, \\phi(G14)=H7$. (H14, H7) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n8.  (G6, G9) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G6)=H6, \\phi(G9)=H13$. (H6, H13) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n9.  (G6, G12) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G6)=H6, \\phi(G12)=H11$. (H6, H11) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n10. (G9, G12) is an edge in G. $\\phi(G9)=H13, \\phi(G12)=H11$. (H13, H11) is an edge in H. (Matches)\n\nAll edges are preserved under the mapping. Since the mapping is a bijection and preserves all adjacencies, G and H are isomorphic.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two graphs G and H are **isomorphic**.",

Verification:**\n\nWe must verify that for every pair of vertices (u, v) in G, (u, v) is an edge in G if and only if (f(u), f(v)) is an edge in H. Since we built the mapping by preserving adjacency, we just need to list G's edges and check if their mapped counterparts exist in H.\n\n**Edges in G (and their mapped counterparts in H):**\n1.  (0, 3) in G maps to (f(0), f(3)) = (6, 7) in H. (Exists: H.6-H.7)\n2.  (1, 14) in G maps to (f(1), f(14)) = (8, 13) in H. (Exists: H.8-H.13)\n3.  (4, 9) in G maps to (f(4), f(9)) = (9, 3) in H. (Exists: H.9-H.3)\n4.  (4, 10) in G maps to (f(4), f(10)) = (9, 10) in H. (Exists: H.9-H.10)\n5.  (5, 6) in G maps to (f(5), f(6)) = (11, 1) in H. (Exists: H.11-H.1)\n6.  (5, 13) in G maps to (f(5), f(13)) = (11, 0) in H. (Exists: H.11-H.0)\n7.  (6, 7) in G maps to (f(6), f(7)) = (1, 14) in H. (Exists: H.1-H.14)\n8.  (7, 9) in G maps to (f(7), f(9)) = (14, 3) in H. (Exists: H.14-H.3)\n9.  (7, 12) in G maps to (f(7), f(12)) = (14, 5) in H. (Exists: H.14-H.5)\n10. (11, 12) in G maps to (f(11), f(12)) = (4, 5) in H. (Exists: H.4-H.5)\n\nAll 10 edges in G correspond to 10 existing edges in H through the mapping `f`. Since the number of edges is the same, and the mapping is a bijection, this confirms that non-edges also map to non-edges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the matching graph invariants (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence) and the successful construction of a bijection that preserves all adjacency relationships, we can conclude that Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

The degree sequence is a fundamental graph invariant, and if it differs, no bijection between vertices can preserve adjacency.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No}$",

Yes. Is $(\\phi(0), \\phi(6)) = (0,8)$ an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Is (3,4) an edge in G? Yes. Is $(\\phi(3), \\phi(4)) = (3,7)$ an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   For any pair of vertices (u,v) not forming an edge in G, their mapped pair $(\\phi(u), \\phi(v))$ must not form an edge in H. Since the number of edges is the same and we've preserved all existing edges, this property is automatically satisfied for non-edges as well. For example, (0,1) is not an edge in G. $(\\phi(0),\\phi(1))=(0,1)$ is not an edge in H.\n\nSince a bijection that preserves adjacency exists, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\n---\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, connected components, and the successful construction of an isomorphism mapping, Graph G and Graph H are structurally identical.\n\n**Therefore, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.**",

Calculate Degrees for Each Vertex in H:**\n*   deg(H_0) = 3 (connected to H_1, H_2, H_10)\n*   deg(H_1) = 4 (connected to H_0, H_2, H_9, H_11)\n*   deg(H_2) = 5 (connected to H_0, H_1, H_4, H_7, H_11)\n*   deg(H_3) = 0 (isolated vertex)\n*   deg(H_4) = 3 (connected to H_2, H_6, H_10)\n*   deg(H_5) = 0 (isolated vertex)\n*   deg(H_6) = 1 (connected to H_4)\n*   deg(H_7) = 1 (connected to H_2)\n*   deg(H_8) = 1 (connected to H_10)\n*   deg(H_9) = 1 (connected to H_1)\n*   deg(H_10) = 3 (connected to H_0, H_4, H_8)\n*   deg(H_11) = 2 (connected to H_1, H_2)\n\n**3. Degree Sequence for H (sorted):**\nThe list of degrees is [3, 4, 5, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2].\nSorting this list gives: **[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]**\n(There are two vertices of degree 0, four vertices of degree 1, one vertex of degree 2, three vertices of degree 3, one vertex of degree 4, and one vertex of degree 5).\n\n**4. Number of Edges (M_H):**\nSum of degrees = 3+4+5+0+3+0+1+1+1+1+3+2 = 24.\nM_H = 24 / 2 = 12 edges.\n\n### Comparison of Invariants\n\n*   **Number of Vertices (N):** N_G = 12, N_H = 12. (Match)\n*   **Number of Edges (M):** M_G = 12, M_H = 12. (Match)\n*   **Degree Sequence:**\n    *   Degree sequence of G: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n    *   Degree sequence of H: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]\n\nThe degree sequences of Graph G and Graph H are different. For two graphs to be isomorphic, they must have the exact same degree sequence. Since this fundamental invariant does not match, the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of their graph invariants, specifically the degree sequences, Graph G and Graph H are **not isomorphic**.",

Let's analyze the properties of nodes based on their degrees, particularly focusing on nodes with unique degree counts or specific connection patterns.\n\n*   **Isolated Vertices (Degree 0):**\n    *   Graph G has one isolated vertex (Node 8).\n    *   Graph H has one isolated vertex (Node 5).\n    *   This is consistent. An isomorphism $f$ would map $f(8)$ to $5$.\n\n*   **Leaf Vertices (Degree 1):**\n    *   Graph G has two vertices with degree 1: Node 5 and Node 7.\n        *   Let's check their adjacency: G_adj[5][7] = 1, meaning Node 5 and Node 7 are connected to each other. They form a connected component (an edge) in G.\n    *   Graph H has two vertices with degree 1: Node 1 and Node 4.\n        *   Let's check their adjacency: H_adj[1][4] = 0, meaning Node 1 and Node 4 are NOT connected to each other.\n        *   Node 1 is connected to Node 8 (deg(8)=2).\n        *   Node 4 is connected to Node 9 (deg(9)=2).\n\n**Conclusion based on Degree 1 Vertices:**\nFor two graphs to be isomorphic, there must exist a bijection between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency. If G and H were isomorphic, the images of G's degree-1 vertices (5 and 7) under this bijection would have to be H's degree-1 vertices (1 and 4). Since 5 and 7 are adjacent in G, their images (1 and 4) must also be adjacent in H for isomorphism to hold. However, 1 and 4 are not adjacent in H.\n\nThis fundamental difference in the local structure around degree-1 vertices proves that the graphs cannot be isomorphic.\n\nAnother way to state this:\n*   Graph G has a connected component that is a $P_2$ (a path of length 1, i.e., a single edge connecting two vertices of degree 1). This component is {5, 7}.\n*   Graph H does not have such a component. Its degree-1 vertices (1 and 4) are connected to vertices within a larger connected component, and they are not connected to each other.\n\nTherefore, since the adjacency relationship of corresponding degree-1 vertices is not preserved, the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No}$",

Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\nNow, we check if `(x,y)` is an edge in G if and only if `(f(x),f(y))` is an edge in H.\n\n*   **Edges in G:**\n    1.  (v1, v5) is an edge in G.\n        Mapped: (f(v1), f(v5)) = (u1, u7). Is (u1, u7) an edge in H? Yes (H[1][7]=1).\n    2.  (v2, v4) is an edge in G.\n        Mapped: (f(v2), f(v4)) = (u2, u4). Is (u2, u4) an edge in H? Yes (H[2][4]=1).\n    3.  (v5, v8) is an edge in G.\n        Mapped: (f(v5), f(v8)) = (u7, u5). Is (u7, u5) an edge in H? Yes (H[7][5]=1).\n    4.  (v6, v7) is an edge in G.\n        Mapped: (f(v6), f(v7)) = (u3, u8). Is (u3, u8) an edge in H? Yes (H[3][8]=1).\n\nAll edges in G are preserved in H under the mapping `f`. Since the number of edges is the same, this also implies that non-edges in G map to non-edges in H. The mapping is a bijection and preserves adjacency.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the matching invariants (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and connected components structure) and the successful construction and verification of an adjacency-preserving bijection, Graph G and Graph H are **isomorphic**.",

Number of Vertices:**\n*   Both matrices are 10x10.\n*   Graph G has $N_G = 10$ vertices (indexed 0 to 9).\n*   Graph H has $N_H = 10$ vertices (indexed 0 to 9).\n*   Since $N_G = N_H$, the first condition for isomorphism is met.\n\n**2. Number of Edges:**\n*   In the adjacency matrix for Graph G, every entry is 0. This means there are no connections between any vertices.\n*   Therefore, Graph G has $M_G = 0$ edges.\n*   Similarly, in the adjacency matrix for Graph H, every entry is 0.\n*   Therefore, Graph H has $M_H = 0$ edges.\n*   Since $M_G = M_H$, the second condition for isomorphism is met.\n\n**3. Graph Structure and Degree Sequence:**\n*   A graph with $N$ vertices and 0 edges is called a **null graph** (or empty graph).\n*   Graph G is a null graph on 10 vertices.\n*   Graph H is a null graph on 10 vertices.\n*   **Degree sequence for G:** For every vertex $v_i$ in G, its degree is the sum of its row (or column) in the adjacency matrix, which is 0. So, the degree sequence for G is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n*   **Degree sequence for H:** Similarly, the degree sequence for H is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n*   The degree sequences are identical.\n\n**4. Existence of a Bijection that Preserves Adjacency:**\nSince both graphs are null graphs on 10 vertices, any bijection between their vertex sets will preserve adjacency. This is because there are no edges in either graph, so the condition \"u and v are adjacent in G if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in H\" is vacuously true (both sides of the \"if and only if\" statement are false).\n\nFor example, consider the identity mapping $f(v_i) = v_i$, where $v_i$ is the $i$-th vertex in G and $v_i$ is also the $i$-th vertex in H.\n*   This is a bijection from the vertices of G to the vertices of H.\n*   Since there are no edges in G, for any pair of distinct vertices $(u,v)$ in G, $(u,v)$ is not an edge.\n*   Since there are no edges in H, for the corresponding pair $(f(u), f(v))$ in H, $(f(u),f(v))$ is also not an edge.\n*   Thus, adjacency (or lack thereof) is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth Graph G and Graph H are null graphs with 10 vertices. Any two null graphs with the same number of vertices are always isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:**\nYes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

      "model_response": "To determine if two graphs G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a bijection (one-to-one mapping) between their vertices that preserves adjacency. We'll follow a systematic approach:\n\n**1. Basic Graph Properties:**\n\n*   **Number of Vertices (N):**\n    *   Graph G has 10 rows/columns, so N_G = 10.\n    *   Graph H has 10 rows/columns, so N_H = 10.\n    *   **Result:** N_G = N_H (10 vertices each). This is a necessary condition.\n\n*   **Degree Sequence and Number of Edges (M):**\n    Let's calculate the degree of each vertex for both graphs. The degree of a vertex is the sum of 1s in its corresponding row (or column) in the adjacency matrix.\n\n    **Graph G Degrees:**\n    *   G0: 2 (connected to G5, G8)\n    *   G1: 1 (connected to G4)\n    *   G2: 1 (connected to G9)\n    *   G3: 1 (connected to G7)\n    *   G4: 1 (connected to G1)\n    *   G5: 1 (connected to G0)\n    *   G6: 2 (connected to G8, G9)\n    *   G7: 1 (connected to G3)\n    *   G8: 2 (connected to G0, G6)\n    *   G9: 2 (connected to G2, G6)\n    *   **Degree Sequence G (sorted):** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n    *   **Sum of Degrees G:** 14\n    *   **Number of Edges G (M_G):** Sum of degrees / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\n\n    **Graph H Degrees:**\n    *   H0: 1 (connected to H4)\n    *   H1: 1 (connected to H8)\n    *   H2: 1 (connected to H5)\n    *   H3: 2 (connected to H4, H9)\n    *   H4: 2 (connected to H0, H3)\n    *   H5: 1 (connected to H2)\n    *   H6: 1 (connected to H7)\n    *   H7: 2 (connected to H6, H9)\n    *   H8: 1 (connected to H1)\n    *   H9: 2 (connected to H3, H7)\n    *   **Degree Sequence H (sorted):** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n    *   **Sum of Degrees H:** 14\n    *   **Number of Edges H (M_H):** Sum of degrees / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\n\n    **Result:** Both graphs have 6 vertices of degree 1 and 4 vertices of degree 2. The sorted degree sequences are identical, and both have 7 edges. These are all necessary conditions for isomorphism.\n\n**2. Analyze Graph Structure (Connected Components):**\n\nSince the basic properties match, we need to delve deeper into their structure. Let's analyze the connected components of each graph.\n\n**Analysis of Graph G:**\n*   **Degree-1 nodes (leaves):** G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G7\n*   **Degree-2 nodes:** G0, G6, G8, G9\n\nLet's trace connections starting from the degree-2 nodes:\n*   G0 (deg 2) is connected to G5 (deg 1) and G8 (deg 2).\n*   G8 (deg 2) is connected to G0 (deg 2) and G6 (deg 2).\n*   G6 (deg 2) is connected to G8 (deg 2) and G9 (deg 2).\n*   G9 (deg 2) is connected to G6 (deg 2) and G2 (deg 1).\n\nThis forms a path of 6 vertices: G5 - G0 - G8 - G6 - G9 - G2. This is a P6 (path graph with 6 vertices). This component uses vertices {G0, G2, G5, G6, G8, G9} and 5 edges.\n\nLet's check the remaining vertices: {G1, G3, G4, G7}.\n*   G1 (deg 1) is connected to G4 (deg 1). This is a P2 (path graph with 2 vertices). This component uses vertices {G1, G4} and 1 edge.\n*   G3 (deg 1) is connected to G7 (deg 1). This is another P2. This component uses vertices {G3, G7} and 1 edge.\n\n**Conclusion for G:** Graph G consists of three connected components: one P6 and two P2s.\n\n**Analysis of Graph H:**\n*   **Degree-1 nodes (leaves):** H0, H1, H2, H5, H6, H8\n*   **Degree-2 nodes:** H3, H4, H7, H9\n\nLet's trace connections starting from the degree-2 nodes:\n*   H4 (deg 2) is connected to H0 (deg 1) and H3 (deg 2).\n*   H3 (deg 2) is connected to H4 (deg 2) and H9 (deg 2).\n*   H9 (deg 2) is connected to H3 (deg 2) and H7 (deg 2).\n*   H7 (deg 2) is connected to H9 (deg 2) and H6 (deg 1).\n\nThis forms a path of 6 vertices: H0 - H4 - H3 - H9 - H7 - H6. This is a P6. This component uses vertices {H0, H3, H4, H6, H7, H9} and 5 edges.\n\nLet's check the remaining vertices: {H1, H2, H5, H8}.\n*   H1 (deg 1) is connected to H8 (deg 1). This is a P2. This component uses vertices {H1, H8} and 1 edge.\n*   H2 (deg 1) is connected to H5 (deg 1). This is another P2. This component uses vertices {H2, H5} and 1 edge.\n\n**Conclusion for H:** Graph H also consists of three connected components: one P6 and two P2s.\n\n**Result:** Both graphs have the same number of connected components, and each corresponding component is isomorphic (P6 to P6, P2 to P2, P2 to P2). This strongly suggests the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**3. Construct a Bijection (Mapping):**\n\nBased on the component analysis, we can propose a mapping $f: V(G) \\to V(H)$:\n\n*   **Mapping the P6 components:**\n    *   Map the ends of G's P6 (G5, G2) to the ends of H's P6 (H0, H6).

Graph H does not contain any isolated vertices (all its vertices have a degree of 1 or more). Because the degree sequences of Graph G and Graph H are different, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No}$.",

Basic Graph Properties Check:**\n\n*   **Number of Vertices (N):**\n    *   Graph G's adjacency matrix is 12x12, so G has N = 12 vertices (V_G = {0, 1, ..., 11}).\n    *   Graph H's adjacency matrix is 12x12, so H has N = 12 vertices (V_H = {0, 1, ..., 11}).\n    *   The number of vertices is the same.\n\n*   **Number of Edges (M):**\n    We count the number of '1's in the upper triangle (or lower triangle) of the adjacency matrices, as the matrices appear symmetric (implying undirected graphs, typical for isomorphism problems).\n\n    *   **Graph G Edges:**\n        *   G[1][6] = 1 (and G[6][1] = 1) -> Edge (1, 6)\n        *   G[4][5] = 1 (and G[5][4] = 1) -> Edge (4, 5)\n        *   All other entries are 0.\n        *   Graph G has M = 2 edges.\n\n    *   **Graph H Edges:**\n        *   H[0][6] = 1 (and H[6][0] = 1) -> Edge (0, 6)\n        *   H[3][11] = 1 (and H[11][3] = 1) -> Edge (3, 11)\n        *   All other entries are 0.\n        *   Graph H has M = 2 edges.\n    *   The number of edges is the same.\n\n**2. Degree Sequence Check:**\nFor two graphs to be isomorphic, their degree sequences must be identical.\n\n*   **Degrees for Graph G:**\n    *   deg(1) = 1 (connected to 6)\n    *   deg(6) = 1 (connected to 1)\n    *   deg(4) = 1 (connected to 5)\n    *   deg(5) = 1 (connected to 4)\n    *   All other vertices (0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) have degree 0.\n    *   Sorted Degree Sequence of G: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] (eight 0s, four 1s)\n\n*   **Degrees for Graph H:**\n    *   deg(0) = 1 (connected to 6)\n    *   deg(6) = 1 (connected to 0)\n    *   deg(3) = 1 (connected to 11)\n    *   deg(11) = 1 (connected to 3)\n    *   All other vertices (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) have degree 0.\n    *   Sorted Degree Sequence of H: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] (eight 0s, four 1s)\n\n*   The degree sequences are identical. This is a necessary condition.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis:**\n\nLet's describe the structure of each graph based on its edges and degrees.\n\n*   **Graph G:**\n    Graph G has 12 vertices. It has two edges: (1, 6) and (4, 5).\n    This means G consists of two disconnected components, each being a single edge (a $K_2$ graph, or a path graph $P_2$).\n    The remaining 8 vertices ({0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}) are isolated vertices (degree 0), not connected to any other vertex or to each other.\n\n*   **Graph H:**\n    Graph H also has 12 vertices. It has two edges: (0, 6) and (3, 11).\n    Similarly, H consists of two disconnected components, each being a single edge ($K_2$ or $P_2$).\n    The remaining 8 vertices ({1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}) are isolated vertices (degree 0).\n\nBoth graphs exhibit the exact same structural decomposition: two disconnected edges and eight isolated vertices. This strong similarity suggests they are isomorphic.\n\n**4. Construction of an Isomorphism (Bijection):**\n\nTo prove isomorphism, we need to find a bijection $f: V_G \\to V_H$ such that for any two vertices $u, v \\in V_G$, $(u, v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H.\n\nWe can define such a mapping based on the structural components:\n\n*   **Mapping the edges:**\n    Let's map the edge (1, 6) from G to the edge (0, 6) in H. We have two options for assigning vertices:\n    1.  $f(1) = 0$\n    2.  $f(6) = 6$\n\n    Then, we map the remaining edge (4, 5) from G to the remaining edge (3, 11) in H:\n    1.  $f(4) = 3$\n    2.  $f(5) = 11$\n\n*   **Mapping the isolated vertices:**\n    The isolated vertices in G are $V_{G,iso} = \\{0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\\}$.\n    The isolated vertices in H are $V_{H,iso} = \\{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\n    Since all these vertices have degree 0, any one-to-one mapping between $V_{G,iso}$ and $V_{H,iso}$ will preserve their non-adjacency properties.\n    A simple mapping for these would be:\n    *   $f(0) = 1$\n    *   $f(2) = 2$\n    *   $f(3) = 4$\n    *   $f(7) = 5$\n    *   $f(8) = 7$\n    *   $f(9) = 8$\n    *   $f(10) = 9$\n    *   $f(11) = 10$\n\n**Complete Isomorphism Mapping $f$:**\n*   $f(1) = 0$\n*   $f(6) = 6$\n*   $f(4) = 3$\n*   $f(5) = 11$\n*   $f(0) = 1$\n*   $f(2) = 2$\n*   $f(3) = 4$\n*   $f(7) = 5$\n*   $f(8) = 7$\n*   $f(9) = 8$\n*   $f(10) = 9$\n*   $f(11) = 10$\n\n**Verification:**\n1.  **Is it a bijection?** Yes, each vertex in G is mapped to a unique vertex in H, and all vertices in H are covered.\n2.  **Does it preserve adjacency?**\n    *   Edge (1, 6) in G: $f(1)=0$, $f(6)=6$. Is (0, 6) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (4, 5) in G: $f(4)=3$, $f(5)=11$. Is (3, 11) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   For any other pair of vertices $(u, v)$ in G that are *not* edges (e.g., $(1, 4)$, $(0, 2)$, etc.), their images $(f(u), f(v))$ must not be edges in H. For instance:\n        *   $(1, 4)$ is not an edge in G. $f(1)=0$, $f(4)=3$. $(0, 3)$ is not an edge in H. Correct.\n        *   $(0, 2)$ is not an edge in G. $f(0)=1$, $f(2)=2$. $(1, 2)$ is not an edge in H. Correct.\n        *   This holds because we mapped connected components to connected components and isolated vertices to isolated vertices.\n\nSince we found a bijection that preserves adjacency relationships, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes, the graphs are isomorphic.}$",

This is strong evidence of isomorphism.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Attempt to Find a Mapping (Bijection $f: V_G \\to V_H$)**\n\nWe need to define a mapping $f$ such that $(u,v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H.\n\n1.  **Mapping Isolated Vertices:**\n    The 5 isolated vertices in G ({0, 2, 6, 7, 10}) can be mapped to the 5 isolated vertices in H ({3, 4, 5, 6, 12}) in any arbitrary bijective way. For example:\n    $f(0) = 3$\n    $f(2) = 4$\n    $f(6) = 5$\n    $f(7) = 6$\n    $f(10) = 12$\n\n2.  **Mapping $P_2$ Components:**\n    G's $P_2$: 9-11\n    H's $P_2$: 8-9\n    We can map:\n    $f(9) = 8$\n    $f(11) = 9$\n    (Check: Edge (9,11) in G maps to (8,9) in H, which is an edge.)\n\n3.  **Mapping $P_6$ Components:**\n    G's $P_6$: 12-4-3-1-5-8 (endpoints are 12 and 8, both degree 1)\n    H's $P_6$: 2-0-11-7-1-10 (endpoints are 2 and 10, both degree 1)\n\n    Let's map an endpoint of G's $P_6$ to an endpoint of H's $P_6$.\n    Try $f(12) = 2$.\n    Since 12 is connected to 4 in G, $f(4)$ must be connected to $f(12)=2$ in H. The only node connected to 2 in H is 0. So, $f(4) = 0$.\n    Since 4 is connected to 3 in G, $f(3)$ must be connected to $f(4)=0$ in H. The other node connected to 0 in H is 11. So, $f(3) = 11$.\n    Since 3 is connected to 1 in G, $f(1)$ must be connected to $f(3)=11$ in H. The other node connected to 11 in H is 7. So, $f(1) = 7$.\n    Since 1 is connected to 5 in G, $f(5)$ must be connected to $f(1)=7$ in H. The other node connected to 7 in H is 1. So, $f(5) = 1$.\n    Since 5 is connected to 8 in G, $f(8)$ must be connected to $f(5)=1$ in H. The other node connected to 1 in H is 10. So, $f(8) = 10$.\n    This completes the mapping for the $P_6$ components.\n\n    **Let's verify the adjacency preservation for $P_6$ components with this mapping:**\n    *   (12,4) in G maps to (f(12), f(4)) = (2,0) in H. (Edge 2-0 exists in H: H[0][2]=1)\n    *   (4,3) in G maps to (f(4), f(3)) = (0,11) in H. (Edge 0-11 exists in H: H[0][11]=1)\n    *   (3,1) in G maps to (f(3), f(1)) = (11,7) in H. (Edge 11-7 exists in H: H[11][7]=1)\n    *   (1,5) in G maps to (f(1), f(5)) = (7,1) in H. (Edge 7-1 exists in H: H[7][1]=1)\n    *   (5,8) in G maps to (f(5), f(8)) = (1,10) in H. (Edge 1-10 exists in H: H[1][10]=1)\n    All edges are preserved.\n\n**Complete Proposed Isomorphism Mapping $f: V_G \\to V_H$:**\n*   $f(0) = 3$\n*   $f(1) = 7$\n*   $f(2) = 4$\n*   $f(3) = 11$\n*   $f(4) = 0$\n*   $f(5) = 1$\n*   $f(6) = 5$\n*   $f(7) = 6$\n*   $f(8) = 10$\n*   $f(9) = 8$\n*   $f(10) = 12$\n*   $f(11) = 9$\n*   $f(12) = 2$\n\nThis mapping is a bijection (each vertex in G maps to a unique vertex in H, and all vertices in H are mapped from G). We have verified that all existing edges in G are mapped to existing edges in H. Since this is an undirected graph, if (u,v) is an edge, then its image (f(u), f(v)) is also an edge. If there were no edge (u,v) in G, then there is no edge (f(u), f(v)) in H because otherwise it would imply an extra edge in H not corresponding to G. The number of edges is equal, so this mapping preserves non-adjacency as well.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and the perfectly matching structures of their connected components (five isolated vertices, one $P_6$ path, and one $P_2$ path in both graphs), and the successful construction of an adjacency-preserving bijection, we can conclude that the two graphs are **isomorphic**.",

Connected Components Analysis:**\n\nLet's examine the structure of the connected components based on the degrees.\nBoth graphs have 6 vertices of degree 0, 4 vertices of degree 1, and 2 vertices of degree 2.\n\n*   **Graph G Components:**\n    *   Isolated vertices (degree 0): {2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11}\n    *   Vertices with edges: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9}\n    *   Edges: (0,8), (1,5), (5,6), (8,9)\n    *   Let's trace paths:\n        *   0 is connected to 8. 8 is connected to 9.

So, we have another path: 1 - 2 - 11 (another P3 graph).\n    *   Graph H consists of 6 isolated vertices and two disconnected P3 graphs.\n\n    *   **Result:** The component structure is identical for both graphs (6 isolated vertices and two P3 paths). This strongly suggests they are isomorphic.\n\n**3. Constructing an Isomorphism Mapping:**\n\nWe need to find a bijection $f: V(G) \\to V(H)$ such that $(u,v)$ is an edge in G if and only if $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H.\n\nLet's define the mapping based on the connected components and degree types:\n\n*   **Mapping Degree 2 Vertices (centers of P3s):**\n    In G, the degree 2 vertices are {5, 8}.\n    In H, the degree 2 vertices are {2, 3}.\n    We can map:\n    *   $f(5) = 2$\n    *   $f(8) = 3$\n\n*   **Mapping Degree 1 Vertices (ends of P3s):**\n    For the P3 `1-5-6` in G:\n    *   Since $f(5)=2$, its neighbors (1 and 6) must map to the neighbors of 2 in H (which are 1 and 11).\n    *   We can map:\n        *   $f(1) = 1$\n        *   $f(6) = 11$ (or $f(1)=11$ and $f(6)=1$; either works)\n\n    For the P3 `0-8-9` in G:\n    *   Since $f(8)=3$, its neighbors (0 and 9) must map to the neighbors of 3 in H (which are 0 and 5).\n    *   We can map:\n        *   $f(0) = 0$\n        *   $f(9) = 5$ (or $f(0)=5$ and $f(9)=0$; either works)\n\n*   **Mapping Degree 0 Vertices (isolated vertices):**\n    *   Remaining vertices in G: {2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11}\n    *   Remaining vertices in H: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n    *   We can map these arbitrarily, as long as it's a bijection and they remain isolated (which they will, as their images are isolated).\n    *   $f(2) = 4$\n    *   $f(3) = 6$\n    *   $f(4) = 7$\n    *   $f(7) = 8$\n    *   $f(10) = 9$\n    *   $f(11) = 10$\n\n**Proposed Isomorphism Mapping `f`:**\n\n*   $f(0) = 0$\n*   $f(1) = 1$\n*   $f(2) = 4$\n*   $f(3) = 6$\n*   $f(4) = 7$\n*   $f(5) = 2$\n*   $f(6) = 11$\n*   $f(7) = 8$\n*   $f(8) = 3$\n*   $f(9) = 5$\n*   $f(10) = 9$\n*   $f(11) = 10$\n\n**4. Verification of the Mapping:**\n\nWe must check that every edge in G maps to an edge in H, and every non-edge in G maps to a non-edge in H. Since the number of edges is the same, checking edges is sufficient.\n\nEdges in G:\n1.  (0, 8) in G: Maps to $(f(0), f(8)) = (0, 3)$ in H. (0,3) is an edge in H (checked from H's matrix A_H[0][3]=1).\n2.  (1, 5) in G: Maps to $(f(1), f(5)) = (1, 2)$ in H. (1,2) is an edge in H (A_H[1][2]=1).\n3.  (5, 6) in G: Maps to $(f(5), f(6)) = (2, 11)$ in H. (2,11) is an edge in H (A_H[2][11]=1).\n4.  (8, 9) in G: Maps to $(f(8), f(9)) = (3, 5)$ in H. (3,5) is an edge in H (A_H[3][5]=1).\n\nAll 4 edges in G are preserved as edges in H under this mapping. Since the mapping is a bijection and preserves all edges, it also preserves all non-edges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the existence of a bijection that preserves adjacency relationships, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

This condition is met.*\n\n**4. Connected Components and Structure**\nLet's analyze the structure formed by the edges and vertex degrees.\n\n*   **Graph G Components:**\n    *   **Nodes with degree 0:** {1, 2, 5, 6, 10} (These are 5 isolated vertices)\n    *   **Nodes with degree 1:** {0, 4, 7, 8}\n    *   **Nodes with degree 2:** {3, 9}\n\n    The edges form two connected components that are not isolated vertices:\n    1.  A path of length 3 (4 vertices, 3 edges): $0 - 9 - 3 - 8$.\n        *   Nodes 0 and 8 have degree 1 (endpoints of the path).\n        *   Nodes 9 and 3 have degree 2 (internal nodes of the path).\n    2.  A path of length 1 (2 vertices, 1 edge): $4 - 7$.\n        *   Nodes 4 and 7 both have degree 1.\n\n*   **Graph H Components:**\n    *   **Nodes with degree 0:** {0, 3, 5, 6, 9} (These are 5 isolated vertices)\n    *   **Nodes with degree 1:** {1, 4, 8, 10}\n    *   **Nodes with degree 2:** {2, 7}\n\n    The edges form two connected components that are not isolated vertices:\n    1.  A path of length 3 (4 vertices, 3 edges): $1 - 2 - 7 - 8$.\n        *   Nodes 1 and 8 have degree 1 (endpoints of the path).\n        *   Nodes 2 and 7 have degree 2 (internal nodes of the path).\n    2.  A path of length 1 (2 vertices, 1 edge): $4 - 10$.\n        *   Nodes 4 and 10 both have degree 1.\n\n*The structure of connected components is identical for both graphs: a disjoint union of a $P_4$ (path of 4 vertices), a $P_2$ (path of 2 vertices), and 5 isolated vertices ($P_1$). This strongly suggests isomorphism.*\n\n**5. Constructing a Bijective Mapping (Isomorphism)**\nBased on the structural analysis, we can define a mapping $f: V(G) \\to V(H)$ that preserves adjacency.\n\n*   **Map the $P_4$ components:**\n    *   G's $P_4$: $0-9-3-8$ (endpoints: 0, 8; internal: 9, 3)\n    *   H's $P_4$: $1-2-7-8$ (endpoints: 1, 8; internal: 2, 7)\n    Let's try to map degree-1 endpoints to degree-1 endpoints, and degree-2 internal nodes to degree-2 internal nodes.\n    1.  Map G's endpoint 0 (deg 1) to H's endpoint 1 (deg 1): $f(0) = 1$.\n    2.  Node 9 is adjacent to 0 in G. So, $f(9)$ must be adjacent to $f(0)=1$ in H. The only node adjacent to 1 in H is 2. So, $f(9) = 2$.\n    3.  Node 3 is adjacent to 9 in G. So, $f(3)$ must be adjacent to $f(9)=2$ in H. Node 2 in H is adjacent to 1 and 7. Since 1 is already mapped (part of the $P_4$ path from the other side), $f(3)$ must be 7. So, $f(3) = 7$.\n    4.  Node 8 is adjacent to 3 in G. So, $f(8)$ must be adjacent to $f(3)=7$ in H. Node 7 in H is adjacent to 2 and 8. Since 2 is already mapped, $f(8)$ must be 8. So, $f(8) = 8$.\n    This maps G's $P_4 (0-9-3-8)$ to H's $P_4 (1-2-7-8)$.\n\n*   **Map the $P_2$ components:**\n    *   G's $P_2$: $4-7$ (both deg 1)\n    *   H's $P_2$: $4-10$ (both deg 1)\n    1.  Map G's node 4 (deg 1) to H's node 4 (deg 1): $f(4) = 4$.\n    2.  Node 7 is adjacent to 4 in G. So, $f(7)$ must be adjacent to $f(4)=4$ in H. The only node adjacent to 4 in H is 10. So, $f(7) = 10$.\n    This maps G's $P_2 (4-7)$ to H's $P_2 (4-10)$.\n\n*   **Map the isolated vertices:**\n    *   G's isolated nodes: {1, 2, 5, 6, 10}\n    *   H's isolated nodes: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}\n    We can map these in any one-to-one fashion:\n    *   $f(1) = 0$\n    *   $f(2) = 3$\n    *   $f(5) = 5$\n    *   $f(6) = 6$\n    *   $f(10) = 9$\n\n**Proposed Isomorphism Mapping $f: V(G) \\to V(H)$:**\n*   $f(0) = 1$\n*   $f(1) = 0$\n*   $f(2) = 3$\n*   $f(3) = 7$\n*   $f(4) = 4$\n*   $f(5) = 5$\n*   $f(6) = 6$\n*   $f(7) = 10$\n*   $f(8) = 8$\n*   $f(9) = 2$\n*   $f(10) = 9$\n\n**6. Verification of the Mapping:**\nWe must check if for every edge $(u,v)$ in G, $(f(u), f(v))$ is an edge in H, and vice-versa (which is automatically covered if the number of edges is the same and the mapping is one-to-one).\n\n*   **G's Edges:**\n    *   $(0, 9) \\in E(G)$  $\\implies (f(0), f(9)) = (1, 2)$. Is $(1, 2) \\in E(H)$? Yes.\n    *   $(3, 8) \\in E(G)$  $\\implies (f(3), f(8)) = (7, 8)$. Is $(7, 8) \\in E(H)$? Yes.\n    *   $(3, 9) \\in E(G)$  $\\implies (f(3), f(9)) = (7, 2)$. Is $(7, 2) \\in E(H)$? Yes.\n    *   $(4, 7) \\in E(G)$  $\\implies (f(4), f(7)) = (4, 10)$. Is $(4, 10) \\in E(H)$? Yes.\n\nAll edges of G are preserved under the mapping $f$ to H. Since the mapping is a bijection and preserves adjacency, the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe graphs G and H are **isomorphic**. They have the same number of vertices, edges, identical degree sequences, and structurally identical connected components (a path $P_4$, a path $P_2$, and 5 isolated vertices). A valid bijective mapping has been constructed and verified.",

Specifically, Graph H has one vertex of degree 4 (node 11), while Graph G does not have any vertex with degree 4 (its maximum degree is 3).\n\nSince the degree sequences of Graph G and Graph H are not identical, these graphs cannot be isomorphic. The existence of a vertex with a degree that is not present in the other graph's degree sequence is a definitive proof that they are not structurally identical.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe two graphs are **not isomorphic**. This is because their degree sequences are different. Graph G has a maximum degree of 3, while Graph H has a maximum degree of 4.",

A bijection (isomorphism) can be constructed by mapping corresponding components and their vertices based on their degrees within the components.\n\n**Example Isomorphism Mapping ($\\phi: V(G) \\to V(H)$):**\n\n*   **Map $P_4$ (G: 8-2-3-6 to H: 2-7-6-1):**\n    *   $\\phi(8) = 2$ (deg 1 to deg 1)\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 7$ (deg 2 to deg 2)\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 6$ (deg 2 to deg 2)\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 1$ (deg 1 to deg 1)\n*   **Map $P_2$ (G: 11-12 to H: 0-5):**\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 0$ (deg 1 to deg 1)\n    *   $\\phi(12) = 5$ (deg 1 to deg 1)\n*   **Map Isolated Vertices:** The 8 isolated vertices in G ({0,1,4,5,7,9,10,13}) can be mapped to the 8 isolated vertices in H ({3,4,8,9,10,11,12,13}) in any one-to-one fashion. For instance:\n    *   $\\phi(0) = 3$\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 4$\n    *   $\\phi(4) = 8$\n    *   $\\phi(5) = 9$\n    *   $\\phi(7) = 10$\n    *   $\\phi(9) = 11$\n    *   $\\phi(10) = 12$\n    *   $\\phi(13) = 13$\n\nThis mapping preserves all adjacencies and non-adjacencies.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes, the graphs are isomorphic.}$",

These are three separate components, each a single vertex (P1 graph).\n2.  **Component 1 (Path):** Start from v1 (deg 1): `v1 - v6 - v4 - v2`. This is a path graph with 4 vertices (P4). Its degree sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.\n3.  **Component 2 (Path):** Start from v3 (deg 1): `v3 - v8 - v0 - v10 - v11`. This is a path graph with 5 vertices (P5). Its degree sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.\n\nSo, Graph G is composed of: three P1 graphs, one P4 graph, and one P5 graph.\n\n**Graph H Adjacency List:**\n*   u0: [u6]\n*   u1: []\n*   u2: [u8]\n*   u3: []\n*   u4: [u7, u9]\n*   u5: [u9]\n*   u6: [u0, u8]\n*   u7: [u4, u10]\n*   u8: [u2, u6]\n*   u9: [u4, u5]\n*   u10: [u7]\n*   u11: []\n\n**Connected Components of H:**\n1.  **Isolated Vertices (Degree 0):** {u1, u3, u11}.

Its degree sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. (Matches G's P4)\n3.  **Component 2 (Path):** Start from u5 (deg 1): `u5 - u9 - u4 - u7 - u10`. This is a path graph with 5 vertices (P5). Its degree sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`. (Matches G's P5)\n\nBoth graphs G and H have the exact same set of connected components: three isolated vertices, one P4, and one P5. Since the connected components are themselves isomorphic (a P4 is isomorphic to a P4, and a P5 is isomorphic to a P5), the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**3. Constructing an Isomorphism Mapping (Example):**\n\nWe can define a bijection `f: V(G) -> V(H)` as follows:\n\n*   **Mapping for P1 Components:**\n    *   `f(v5) = u1`\n    *   `f(v7) = u3`\n    *   `f(v9) = u11`\n\n*   **Mapping for P4 Components:**\n    *   G: `v1 - v6 - v4 - v2`\n    *   H: `u0 - u6 - u8 - u2`\n    *   `f(v1) = u0`\n    *   `f(v6) = u6`\n    *   `f(v4) = u8`\n    *   `f(v2) = u2`\n\n*   **Mapping for P5 Components:**\n    *   G: `v3 - v8 - v0 - v10 - v11`\n    *   H: `u10 - u7 - u4 - u9 - u5`\n    *   `f(v3) = u10`\n    *   `f(v8) = u7`\n    *   `f(v0) = u4`\n    *   `f(v10) = u9`\n    *   `f(v11) = u5`\n\n**4. Verification of the Mapping:**\nWe need to ensure that for every pair of vertices (x, y) in G, (x, y) is an edge in G if and only if (f(x), f(y)) is an edge in H.\n\nLet's pick a few examples:\n*   In G, (v0, v8) is an edge. `f(v0) = u4`, `f(v8) = u7`. In H, (u4, u7) is an edge. (Matches)\n*   In G, (v10, v11) is an edge. `f(v10) = u9`, `f(v11) = u5`. In H, (u9, u5) is an edge. (Matches)\n*   In G, (v4, v6) is an edge. `f(v4) = u8`, `f(v6) = u6`. In H, (u8, u6) is an edge. (Matches)\n*   Consider a non-edge: In G, (v0, v1) is not an edge. `f(v0) = u4`, `f(v1) = u0`. In H, (u4, u0) is not an edge. (Matches)\n\nThe constructed mapping `f` successfully preserves the adjacency relationships between all vertices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the matching number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and identical decomposition into connected components (three P1s, one P4, and one P5 for both graphs), and the successful construction of an explicit isomorphism mapping, we can conclude that the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe two graphs are **isomorphic**.",

This is a strong indicator that the graphs might be isomorphic.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Connected Components and Structure**\n\nLet's break down the graphs into their connected components:\n\n*   **Graph G Components:**\n    1.  **Isolated vertices (degree 0):** {V2}, {V6}\n    2.  **Path of length 1 (P2, two vertices, each degree 1):** {V0, V7} (edge V0-V7)\n    3.  **Path of length 4 (P5, five vertices):** {V1, V3, V4, V5, V8}\n        *   The structure is V8 - V3 - V1 - V4 - V5.\n        *   Degrees within this component: deg(V8)=1, deg(V3)=2, deg(V1)=2, deg(V4)=2, deg(V5)=1.\n    *   Graph G is a forest (a collection of trees), specifically consisting of two isolated vertices, one P2, and one P5. It contains no cycles.\n\n*   **Graph H Components:**\n    1.  **Isolated vertices (degree 0):** {V1'}, {V5'}\n    2.  **Path of length 1 (P2, two vertices, each degree 1):** {V2', V6'} (edge V2'-V6')\n    3.  **Path of length 4 (P5, five vertices):** {V0', V3', V4', V7', V8'}\n        *   The structure is V4' - V0' - V8' - V7' - V3'.\n        *   Degrees within this component: deg(V4')=1, deg(V0')=2, deg(V8')=2, deg(V7')=2, deg(V3')=1.\n    *   Graph H is also a forest, consisting of two isolated vertices, one P2, and one P5. It contains no cycles.\n\nThe structure of connected components matches perfectly in terms of type, size, and internal vertex degrees. This provides very strong evidence for isomorphism.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Construct an Isomorphism Mapping**\n\nBased on the structural analysis, we can define a bijection $\\phi: V_G \\to V_H$ that preserves adjacency.\n\n1.  **Map Isolated Vertices:**\n    *   $\\phi(V2) = V1'$\n    *   $\\phi(V6) = V5'$\n\n2.  **Map P2 Component:**\n    *   $\\phi(V0) = V2'$ (V0 connected to V7, V2' connected to V6')\n    *   $\\phi(V7) = V6'$\n\n3.  **Map P5 Component (V8-V3-V1-V4-V5 in G to V4'-V0'-V8'-V7'-V3' in H):**\n    *   Map endpoints (degree 1 in P5, degree 1 overall):\n        *   Let's map $\\phi(V8) = V4'$.\n        *   Then $\\phi(V5) = V3'$.\n    *   Map internal vertices (degree 2 in P5, degree 2 overall):\n        *   V8 is connected to V3 in G. $\\phi(V8) = V4'$ is connected to V0' in H. So, $\\phi(V3) = V0'$.\n        *   V5 is connected to V4 in G. $\\phi(V5) = V3'$ is connected to V7' in H. So, $\\phi(V4) = V7'$.\n        *   The remaining vertex in G's P5 is V1. The remaining vertex in H's P5 is V8'. So, $\\phi(V1) = V8'$.\n\n**Proposed Isomorphism Mapping $\\phi$:**\n*   $\\phi(V0) = V2'$\n*   $\\phi(V1) = V8'$\n*   $\\phi(V2) = V1'$\n*   $\\phi(V3) = V0'$\n*   $\\phi(V4) = V7'$\n*   $\\phi(V5) = V3'$\n*   $\\phi(V6) = V5'$\n*   $\\phi(V7) = V6'$\n*   $\\phi(V8) = V4'$\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Verify Adjacency Preservation**\n\nWe must check if for every edge (u, v) in G, the pair ($\\phi(u), \\phi(v)$) is an edge in H.\n\n*   (V0, V7) in G: $\\phi(V0)=V2'$, $\\phi(V7)=V6'$. Is (V2', V6') an edge in H? Yes.\n*   (V1, V3) in G: $\\phi(V1)=V8'$, $\\phi(V3)=V0'$. Is (V8', V0') an edge in H? Yes.\n*   (V1, V4) in G: $\\phi(V1)=V8'$, $\\phi(V4)=V7'$. Is (V8', V7') an edge in H? Yes.\n*   (V3, V8) in G: $\\phi(V3)=V0'$, $\\phi(V8)=V4'$. Is (V0', V4') an edge in H? Yes.\n*   (V4, V5) in G: $\\phi(V4)=V7'$, $\\phi(V5)=V3'$. Is (V7', V3') an edge in H? Yes.\n\nAll 5 edges in G are preserved as edges in H under this mapping. Since the number of vertices and edges are equal, this also implies that all non-edges in G are mapped to non-edges in H. The mapping is a bijection that preserves adjacency relationships.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the matching number of vertices, number of edges, identical degree sequences, and identical connected component structures, and finally, the successful construction and verification of an explicit adjacency-preserving bijection between their vertices, we can confidently conclude that Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.",

(Match)\n4.  **Connected Components:**\n    *   Both Graph G and Graph H consist of one connected component that is a Path Graph of length 4 (P4).\n    *   Both graphs also have 7 isolated vertices (nodes with degree 0).\n\nSince all these graph invariants match, it is highly probable that the graphs are isomorphic. To confirm, we can define an explicit isomorphism mapping (bijection) $\\phi: V_G \\rightarrow V_H$ that preserves adjacency.\n\nLet's map the nodes of the P4 component in G (1-2-5-6) to the P4 component in H (4-2-7-5).\n\n*   Map degree-1 nodes of G to degree-1 nodes of H:\n    *   Let $\\phi(1) = 4$\n    *   Let $\\phi(6) = 5$\n*   Map degree-2 nodes of G to degree-2 nodes of H:\n    *   Node 2 in G is connected to 1 and 5. Since $\\phi(1)=4$, $\\phi(2)$ must be connected to 4 in H. Node 2 in H is connected to 4. So, let $\\phi(2) = 2$.\n    *   Node 5 in G is connected to 2 and 6. Since $\\phi(2)=2$ and $\\phi(6)=5$, $\\phi(5)$ must be connected to 2 and 5 in H. Node 7 in H is connected to 2 and 5. So, let $\\phi(5) = 7$.\n\nNow, verify the adjacency for these mapped nodes:\n*   Edge (1,2) in G maps to ($\\phi(1),\\phi(2)$) = (4,2) in H. (Edge exists in H)\n*   Edge (2,5) in G maps to ($\\phi(2),\\phi(5)$) = (2,7) in H. (Edge exists in H)\n*   Edge (5,6) in G maps to ($\\phi(5),\\phi(6)$) = (7,5) in H. (Edge exists in H)\nThis confirms the mapping for the connected components.\n\nFinally, map the isolated vertices. We need to map the set {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10} from G to the set {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10} from H. Any bijection will work as they are isolated.\n*   $\\phi(0) = 0$\n*   $\\phi(3) = 1$\n*   $\\phi(4) = 3$\n*   $\\phi(7) = 6$\n*   $\\phi(8) = 8$\n*   $\\phi(9) = 9$\n*   $\\phi(10) = 10$\n\nThis complete mapping $\\phi$ is a bijection that preserves all adjacency relationships.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe two graphs G and H are **isomorphic**. They share the same number of vertices, edges, degree sequence, and identical structural components (one path graph P4 and seven isolated vertices).",

We now proceed to a structural analysis.\n\n**2. Structural Analysis and Mapping:**\n\n*   **Graph G Structure:**\n    *   The edges are {0,6} and {6,7}.\n    *   This forms a connected component consisting of vertices 0, 6, and 7, which is a path graph of length 2 (P3): 0 -- 6 -- 7.\n    *   Vertex 6 is the central node with degree 2.\n    *   Vertices 0 and 7 are the end nodes with degree 1.\n    *   The remaining vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8) have a degree of 0, meaning they are isolated nodes.\n\n*   **Graph H Structure:**\n    *   The edges are {1,6} and {1,8}.\n    *   This forms a connected component consisting of vertices 1, 6, and 8, which is also a path graph of length 2 (P3): 6 -- 1 -- 8.\n    *   Vertex 1 is the central node with degree 2.\n    *   Vertices 6 and 8 are the end nodes with degree 1.\n    *   The remaining vertices (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7) have a degree of 0, meaning they are isolated nodes.\n\nBoth graphs have the exact same structure: one P3 component and six isolated vertices. This strongly suggests they are isomorphic.\n\n**3. Constructing an Isomorphism Mapping ($\\phi: V_G \\to V_H$):**\n\nTo prove isomorphism, we need to find a bijection $\\phi$ such that for any two vertices $u, v \\in V_G$, $\\{u, v\\}$ is an edge in G if and only if $\\{\\phi(u), \\phi(v)\\}$ is an edge in H.\n\nLet's define a mapping based on the structural roles of the vertices:\n\n*   **Map the central degree-2 nodes:**\n    *   In G, node 6 has degree 2. In H, node 1 has degree 2.\n    *   Let $\\phi(6) = 1$.\n\n*   **Map the degree-1 nodes adjacent to the central node:**\n    *   In G, nodes 0 and 7 are adjacent to 6 (and have degree 1).\n    *   In H, nodes 6 and 8 are adjacent to 1 (and have degree 1).\n    *   We can map them as:\n        *   $\\phi(0) = 6$\n        *   $\\phi(7) = 8$\n    (Alternatively, $\\phi(0)=8$ and $\\phi(7)=6$ would also work.)\n\n*   **Map the isolated (degree-0) nodes:**\n    *   The remaining nodes in G are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}.\n    *   The remaining nodes in H are {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}.\n    *   We can map them in any one-to-one fashion:\n        *   $\\phi(1) = 0$\n        *   $\\phi(2) = 2$\n        *   $\\phi(3) = 3$\n        *   $\\phi(4) = 4$\n        *   $\\phi(5) = 5$\n        *   $\\phi(8) = 7$\n\n**4. Verification of the Mapping:**\n\nLet's check if this mapping preserves adjacency:\n\n*   **Edges in G:**\n    *   Edge {0, 6} in G: $\\phi(0) = 6$, $\\phi(6) = 1$. Is {6, 1} an edge in H? Yes (A_H[6][1]=1 or A_H[1][6]=1).\n    *   Edge {6, 7} in G: $\\phi(6) = 1$, $\\phi(7) = 8$. Is {1, 8} an edge in H? Yes (A_H[1][8]=1 or A_H[8][1]=1).\n\n*   **Non-edges in G:**\n    *   Consider any pair that is NOT an edge in G, e.g., {0,1}.\n    *   $\\phi(0) = 6$, $\\phi(1) = 0$. Is {6,0} an edge in H? No (A_H[6][0]=0 and A_H[0][6]=0). This holds true for all non-edges.\n\nSince this bijection preserves all adjacency relationships (edges map to edges, and non-edges map to non-edges), the graphs G and H are isomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGraphs G and H are **isomorphic**. They both consist of one path of length 2 (P3) and six isolated vertices. A specific bijection that demonstrates this isomorphism has been provided.",

Since the number of vertices and edges are identical and the mapping is a bijection, preserving edges implies preserving non-edges.\n\n    *   Edge (1,11) in G: $f(1)=2, f(11)=10$. Is (2,10) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (2,8) in G: $f(2)=6, f(8)=11$. Is (6,11) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (2,12) in G: $f(2)=6, f(12)=5$. Is (6,5) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (3,5) in G: $f(3)=4, f(5)=8$. Is (4,8) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (6,12) in G: $f(6)=1, f(12)=5$. Is (1,5) an edge in H? Yes.\n    *   Edge (8,12) in G: $f(8)=11, f(12)=5$. Is (11,5) an edge in H? Yes.\n\n    All edges are preserved under the mapping.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identical number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequences, and the matching structure of their connected components, we were able to construct a bijection that preserves adjacency. Therefore, graphs G and H are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** The two graphs are **isomorphic**.",

We can establish an isomorphism by mapping the connected pair from the Left Graph (e.g., 8 and 10) to the connected pair in the Right Graph (7 and 9), and then mapping the remaining isolated nodes arbitrarily between the two sets of isolated nodes. For example, a possible mapping could be f(8)=7, f(10)=9, and then mapping the remaining 10 isolated nodes from Left to the 10 isolated nodes from Right (e.g., f(0)=0, f(1)=1, ..., f(7)=8, f(9)=10, f(11)=11).\n\nTherefore, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the two graphs are isomorphic.",

Neither graph contains any cycles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll structural properties (number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence, and breakdown of connected components) are identical for both graphs. This strongly suggests they are isomorphic.\n\nWe can define an isomorphism (a mapping of vertices from Left to Right) to confirm:\n*   Map isolated vertices (degree 0):\n    *   f(0) = 1\n    *   f(1) = 2\n    *   f(2) = 4\n    *   f(7) = 5\n    *   f(8) = 9\n    *   f(9) = 10\n*   Map the P2 component (degree 1 to degree 1):\n    *   f(3) = 0\n    *   f(4) = 3\n*   Map the P3 component (degree 1-2-1 to degree 1-2-1):\n    *   f(5) = 6 (center node, degree 2)\n    *   f(6) = 7 (leaf node, degree 1)\n    *   f(10) = 8 (leaf node, degree 1)\n\nLet's check the edges with this mapping:\n*   Left (3,4) maps to Right (f(3),f(4)) = (0,3). Edge (0,3) exists in Right.\n*   Left (5,6) maps to Right (f(5),f(6)) = (6,7). Edge (6,7) exists in Right.\n*   Left (5,10) maps to Right (f(5),f(10)) = (6,8). Edge (6,8) exists in Right.\n\nAll edges are preserved under this mapping. Therefore, the graphs are structurally identical.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$",

Node 2 (R) is a leaf attached to 8 (R). So, f(10) = 2.\n        *   Nodes 7 and 9 are neighbors of 1 in the cycle in L. Nodes 10 and 9 are neighbors of 8 in the cycle in R. We've used 10 (mapped to 2). So, the other two cycle neighbors of 1 must map to 10 and 9 in R.\n        *   Node 7 (L) is deg 3, with a leaf 4. Node 9 (R) is deg 3, with a leaf 7. This aligns.\n        *   So, let's map f(7) = 9.\n        *   Since node 4 (L) is a leaf attached to 7 (L), its image must be a leaf attached to 9 (R). Node 7 (R) is a leaf attached to 9 (R). So, f(4) = 7.\n        *   Now, for the remaining cycle nodes (deg 2):\n            *   Node 9 (L) is connected to 1 and 8.\n            *   Node 8 (L) is connected to 7 and 9.\n            *   We have f(1)=8, f(7)=9.\n            *   The cycle neighbors of f(1)=8 (R) are 10 and 9. We know f(7)=9, so f(9) must be 10.\n            *   The cycle neighbors of f(7)=9 (R) are 8 and 4. We know f(1)=8, so f(8) must be 4.\n\n    *   Proposed mapping for the main components:\n        *   f(1) = 8\n        *   f(10) = 2\n        *   f(7) = 9\n        *   f(4) = 7\n        *   f(9) = 10\n        *   f(8) = 4\n\n    *   **Verification of edges for the main components:**\n        *   (10, 1) in L -> (f(10), f(1)) = (2, 8) in R (Exists)\n        *   (1, 7) in L -> (f(1), f(7)) = (8, 9) in R (Exists)\n        *   (1, 9) in L -> (f(1), f(9)) = (8, 10) in R (Exists)\n        *   (7, 4) in L -> (f(7), f(4)) = (9, 7) in R (Exists)\n        *   (7, 8) in L -> (f(7), f(8)) = (9, 4) in R (Exists)\n        *   (9, 8) in L -> (f(9), f(8)) = (10, 4) in R (Exists)\n    All edges map correctly.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll properties (number of vertices, number of edges, degree distribution, and structural components) are identical between the two graphs. We successfully constructed an isomorphism mapping, confirming that the graphs are structurally identical despite their different visual layouts and node labels.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$.",

Attempt to find a Vertex Mapping (Isomorphism):**\n\nWe can find a mapping (a bijection) `f` from the vertices of the Left Graph to the vertices of the Right Graph that preserves adjacency.\n\n*   Map the central vertex (degree 4): `f(6) = 1`\n*   Map the vertices connected to the central vertex (degree 1):\n    *   `f(0) = 2` (or 3, 4, 5)\n    *   `f(3) = 3` (or 2, 4, 5, if not already mapped)\n    *   `f(4) = 4` (or 2, 3, 5, if not already mapped)\n    *   `f(7) = 5` (or 2, 3, 4, if not already mapped)\n*   Map the isolated vertices (degree 0):\n    *   `f(1) = 0` (or 6, 7)\n    *   `f(2) = 6` (or 0, 7, if not already mapped)\n    *   `f(5) = 7` (or 0, 6, if not already mapped)\n\nFor example, one possible isomorphic mapping is:\n*   `f(6) = 1`\n*   `f(0) = 2`\n*   `f(3) = 3`\n*   `f(4) = 4`\n*   `f(7) = 5`\n*   `f(1) = 0`\n*   `f(2) = 6`\n*   `f(5) = 7`\n\nUnder this mapping, if an edge exists in the Left Graph, it also exists in the Right Graph between the mapped vertices, and vice-versa. For example, (6,0) is an edge in LG. `f(6)=1` and `f(0)=2`, and (1,2) is an edge in RG. All other connections and non-connections are similarly preserved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the same underlying structural pattern (a star graph with three isolated vertices), the two graphs are indeed isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$",

This is another necessary condition met.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Connected Components and Structure**\n\n*   **Left Graph (G1):**\n    *   It has three distinct connected components:\n        1.  **Path of length 2 (P3 graph):** Consists of vertices {0, 4, 6} and edges {(0, 4), (4, 6)}.

Both nodes 5 and 10 have degree 1.\n        3.  **Seven isolated vertices (K1):** {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11}. All have degree 0.\n\n*   **Right Graph (G2):**\n    *   It also has three distinct connected components:\n        1.  **Path of length 2 (P3 graph):** Consists of vertices {10, 1, 9} and edges {(10, 1), (1, 9)}. Node 1 has degree 2, and nodes 10 and 9 have degree 1.\n        2.  **Path of length 1 (P2 graph or K2):** Consists of vertices {0, 8} and edge {(0, 8)}. Both nodes 0 and 8 have degree 1.\n        3.  **Seven isolated vertices (K1):** {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11}. All have degree 0.\n\nBoth graphs have the same number and types of connected components: one P3, one P2, and seven K1 (isolated vertices). This strong structural similarity suggests they are isomorphic.\n\n**Step 4: Propose an Isomorphism Mapping**\n\nLet's define a mapping `f` from the vertices of G1 to G2 that preserves adjacency.\n\n1.  **Map the unique degree-2 node (center of P3):**\n    *   In G1, node 4 has degree 2.\n    *   In G2, node 1 has degree 2.\n    *   Let `f(4) = 1`.\n\n2.  **Map the neighbors of the degree-2 node (ends of P3):**\n    *   Neighbors of 4 in G1 are {0, 6}.\n    *   Neighbors of 1 in G2 are {10, 9}.\n    *   Let `f(0) = 10` and `f(6) = 9` (the choice here is arbitrary for 0 and 6, we could swap them).\n    *   This maps the P3 component (0-4-6) in G1 to (10-1-9) in G2.\n\n3.  **Map the nodes forming the P2 component:**\n    *   In G1, nodes 5 and 10 form the P2 component (edge (5,10)).\n    *   In G2, nodes 0 and 8 form the P2 component (edge (0,8)).\n    *   Let `f(5) = 0` and `f(10) = 8`.\n    *   This maps the P2 component (5-10) in G1 to (0-8) in G2.\n\n4.  **Map the isolated nodes:**\n    *   Remaining isolated nodes in G1: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11}.\n    *   Remaining isolated nodes in G2: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11}.\n    *   We can map these directly as long as each G1 isolated node maps to a unique G2 isolated node:\n        *   `f(1) = 2`\n        *   `f(2) = 3`\n        *   `f(3) = 4`\n        *   `f(7) = 5`\n        *   `f(8) = 6`\n        *   `f(9) = 7`\n        *   `f(11) = 11`\n\n**Step 5: Verify the mapping**\nLet's check if the edges are preserved under this mapping:\n*   Edge (0, 4) in G1: `f(0) = 10`, `f(4) = 1`. Is (10, 1) an edge in G2? Yes.\n*   Edge (4, 6) in G1: `f(4) = 1`, `f(6) = 9`. Is (1, 9) an edge in G2? Yes.\n*   Edge (5, 10) in G1: `f(5) = 0`, `f(10) = 8`. Is (0, 8) an edge in G2? Yes.\n\nAll edges in G1 are mapped to existing edges in G2, and since the number of edges and vertices are the same, this is a valid isomorphism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identical number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and the structural equivalence of their connected components, the two graphs are indeed isomorphic. We have successfully found a mapping that transforms one into the other while preserving their adjacency relationships.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Yes}$",

Since they have the same number and types of connected components, they are likely isomorphic.\n\n**4. Construct an Isomorphism (Mapping):**\n\nTo confirm isomorphism, we need to find a bijective function (mapping) `f` from the vertices of the Left Graph to the vertices of the Right Graph such that `(u, v)` is an edge in the Left Graph if and only if `(f(u), f(v))` is an edge in the Right Graph.\n\nLet's define the mapping `f`:\n\n*   **Map Isolated Vertices:**\n    *   f(0) = 1\n    *   f(1) = 2\n    *   f(6) = 6\n    (Any permutation of isolated vertices would work as long as it maps isolated to isolated).\n\n*   **Map Path Vertices:**\n    The path in the Left Graph is `2 - 7 - 3 - 4 - 8 - 5`.\n    The path in the Right Graph is `7 - 8 - 0 - 4 - 3 - 5`.\n\n    Let's map endpoints of the paths and then follow the connections:\n    *   Map the endpoint `2` (deg 1) from Left to `7` (deg 1) in Right:\n        *   `f(2) = 7`\n    *   Now, `2` is connected to `7` in Left. So `f(7)` must be connected to `f(2)=7` in Right. The only other vertex connected to `7` in Right is `8`.\n        *   `f(7) = 8`\n    *   `7` is connected to `3` in Left. So `f(3)` must be connected to `f(7)=8` in Right. The only other vertex connected to `8` in Right (other than 7) is `0`.\n        *   `f(3) = 0`\n    *   `3` is connected to `4` in Left. So `f(4)` must be connected to `f(3)=0` in Right. The only other vertex connected to `0` in Right (other than 8) is `4`.\n        *   `f(4) = 4`\n    *   `4` is connected to `8` in Left. So `f(8)` must be connected to `f(4)=4` in Right. The only other vertex connected to `4` in Right (other than 0) is `3`.\n        *   `f(8) = 3`\n    *   `8` is connected to `5` (endpoint) in Left. So `f(5)` must be connected to `f(8)=3` in Right. The only other vertex connected to `3` in Right (other than 4) is `5`.\n        *   `f(5) = 5`\n\n**Summary of Mapping `f`:**\n*   f(0) = 1\n*   f(1) = 2\n*   f(2) = 7\n*   f(3) = 0\n*   f(4) = 4\n*   f(5) = 5\n*   f(6) = 6\n*   f(7) = 8\n*   f(8) = 3\n\n**5. Verify the Mapping for Edges:**\n\n*   (5,8) in Left -> (f(5), f(8)) = (5,3) in Right (Edge exists)\n*   (8,4) in Left -> (f(8), f(4)) = (3,4) in Right (Edge exists)\n*   (4,3) in Left -> (f(4), f(3)) = (4,0) in Right (Edge exists)\n*   (3,7) in Left -> (f(3), f(7)) = (0,8) in Right (Edge exists)\n*   (7,2) in Left -> (f(7), f(2)) = (8,7) in Right (Edge exists)\n\nAll edges in the Left Graph map to edges in the Right Graph, and since `f` is a bijection, no non-edges are mapped to edges.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll properties match, and a valid isomorphism mapping can be constructed.\n\nThe two graphs are isomorphic.",

This component has 1 vertex with degree 0.\n    *   **Component 4 (Isolated Vertex):** Node {7}. This component has 1 vertex with degree 0.\n\nBoth graphs have the exact same set of connected components: one path of 5 vertices (P5), one path of 2 vertices (P2), and two isolated vertices (P1). This strongly indicates isomorphism.\n\n**4. Construct a Mapping (Isomorphism):**\n\nWe can define a mapping (a bijection) `f` from the vertices of the Left Graph to the vertices of the Right Graph that preserves adjacency.\n\n*   **Map Isolated Vertices (Degree 0):**\n    *   f(3) = 5\n    *   f(5) = 7\n\n*   **Map P2 Components (Degree 1 nodes connected):**\n    *   Left P2: (0, 2)\n    *   Right P2: (0, 1)\n    *   Let's map: f(0) = 0, f(2) = 1\n\n*   **Map P5 Components (Two Degree 1 ends, three Degree 2 middles):**\n    *   Left P5 ends (deg 1): {4, 6}\n    *   Right P5 ends (deg 1): {2, 3}\n    *   Let's map f(4) = 2. Then, f(6) must be 3.\n\n    *   Now map the internal nodes based on connections:\n        *   In Left, 7 is connected to 4. In Right, 8 is connected to 2 (which is f(4)). So, f(7) = 8.\n        *   In Left, 8 is connected to 7 and 1. In Right, 6 is connected to 8 (which is f(7)) and 4. So, f(8) = 6.\n        *   In Left, 1 is connected to 8 and 6. In Right, 4 is connected to 6 (which is f(8)) and 3 (which is f(6)). So, f(1) = 4.\n\n**Proposed Isomorphism Mapping f(Left Vertex) -> Right Vertex:**\n*   f(0) = 0\n*   f(1) = 4\n*   f(2) = 1\n*   f(3) = 5\n*   f(4) = 2\n*   f(5) = 7\n*   f(6) = 3\n*   f(7) = 8\n*   f(8) = 6\n\n**Verification of Adjacency Preservation:**\n\nLet's check if (u, v) is an edge in the Left Graph if and only if (f(u), f(v)) is an edge in the Right Graph.\n\n*   Edge (4,7) in Left -> (f(4), f(7)) = (2,8) in Right. (Yes, (2,8) is an edge in Right)\n*   Edge (7,8) in Left -> (f(7), f(8)) = (8,6) in Right. (Yes, (8,6) is an edge in Right)\n*   Edge (8,1) in Left -> (f(8), f(1)) = (6,4) in Right. (Yes, (6,4) is an edge in Right)\n*   Edge (1,6) in Left -> (f(1), f(6)) = (4,3) in Right. (Yes, (4,3) is an edge in Right)\n*   Edge (0,2) in Left -> (f(0), f(2)) = (0,1) in Right. (Yes, (0,1) is an edge in Right)\n\nAll edges are preserved. Since the number of vertices and edges are the same, and the mapping preserves all edges, it also preserves all non-edges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the number of vertices, edges, degree sequences, and connected components, and by successfully constructing an adjacency-preserving mapping, we conclude that the two graphs are structurally identical.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe two graphs are isomorphic.",

Number of Edges (M):**\n*   **Left Graph:** Let's list the edges present in the Left Graph:\n    *   (0, 4)\n    *   (1, 3)\n    *   (2, 6)\n    *   (2, 8)\n    *   (2, 10)\n    *   (3, 9)\n    *   (3, 14)\n    *   (6, 9)\n    *   (6, 12)\n    *   Total M = 9 edges.\n*   **Right Graph:** Let's list the edges present in the Right Graph:\n    *   (0, 14)\n    *   (1, 4)\n    *   (2, 12)\n    *   (3, 11)\n    *   (4, 5)\n    *   (4, 6)\n    *   (6, 11)\n    *   (6, 13)\n    *   (7, 14)\n    *   (8, 14)\n    *   (9, 14)\n    *   (10, 14)\n    *   (11, 13)\n    *   (12, 14)\n    *   (13, 14)\n    *   Total M = 15 edges.\n*   **Conclusion:** The number of edges is different for the two graphs (9 for Left Graph vs. 15 for Right Graph).\n\n**3.

This violates the Handshaking Lemma (which states the sum of degrees must be even for any undirected graph). This indicates a potential issue with the drawing of the Left Graph itself (e.g., a missing or extra edge, or it's not a simple undirected graph). However, for the purpose of this analysis, we are interpreting the graph as visually presented.*\n*   **Right Graph Degrees:**\n    *   deg(0)=1, deg(1)=1, deg(2)=1, deg(3)=1, deg(4)=3, deg(5)=1, deg(6)=3, deg(7)=1, deg(8)=1, deg(9)=1, deg(10)=1, deg(11)=3, deg(12)=2, deg(13)=3, deg(14)=7.\n    *   Sorted Degree Sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7]\n*   **Conclusion:** The degree sequences are significantly different (e.g., Left Graph has 4 isolated vertices, Right Graph has none; Left Graph's maximum degree is 3, Right Graph's maximum degree is 7).\n\n**Final Determination:**\nFor two graphs to be isomorphic, they must have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges. While both graphs have 15 vertices, the Left Graph has 9 edges, and the Right Graph has 15 edges. Since the number of edges is different, the two graphs cannot be isomorphic.

Neighbors of 2 in Right are 1 and 7. Since 1 is already mapped to 0, f(3) must be 7 (maps a degree-2 middle node).\n    *   Since (3,8) is an edge in Left, (f(3), f(8)) = (7, f(8)) must be an edge in Right. Neighbors of 7 in Right are 2 and 8.

The only neighbor of 4 in Right is 10. So, f(7) = 10 (maps a degree-1 node).\n    *   This part of the mapping is consistent: (4->4, 7->10)\n\n*   **Mapping the Isolated Vertices (Degree 0):**\n    *   Left Isolated: {1, 2, 5, 6, 10}\n    *   Right Isolated: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}\n    We can map these one-to-one in any way:\n    *   f(1) = 0\n    *   f(2) = 3\n    *   f(5) = 5\n    *   f(6) = 6\n    *   f(10) = 9\n\n**Full Proposed Isomorphism `f`:**\n*   f(0) = 1\n*   f(1) = 0\n*   f(2) = 3\n*   f(3) = 7\n*   f(4) = 4\n*   f(5) = 5\n*   f(6) = 6\n*   f(7) = 10\n*   f(8) = 8\n*   f(9) = 2\n*   f(10) = 9\n\n**Verification of the mapping:**\n*   (0,9) in Left -> (f(0),f(9)) = (1,2) in Right (Exists)\n*   (9,3) in Left -> (f(9),f(3)) = (2,7) in Right (Exists)\n*   (3,8) in Left -> (f(3),f(8)) = (7,8) in Right (Exists)\n*   (4,7) in Left -> (f(4),f(7)) = (4,10) in Right (Exists)\n\nAll edges in the Left Graph map to edges in the Right Graph.

Mapping (Isomorphism):**\nWe can define a mapping (relabeling) from the vertices of the Left Graph to the Right Graph that preserves adjacency:\n\n*   Map the central node of P3:\n    *   `f(6_L) = 1_R` (both are degree 2)\n\n*   Map the endpoints of P3:\n    *   `f(0_L) = 8_R` (both are degree 1, connected to the central node)\n    *   `f(7_L) = 6_R` (both are degree 1, connected to the central node)\n\n*   Map the isolated nodes (any permutation will work, as they are all degree 0 and not connected to anything):\n    *   `f(1_L) = 0_R`\n    *   `f(2_L) = 2_R`\n    *   `f(3_L) = 3_R`\n    *   `f(4_L) = 4_R`\n    *   `f(5_L) = 5_R`\n    *   `f(8_L) = 7_R`\n\nLet's check adjacency with this mapping:\n*   Edge (0_L, 6_L) exists in Left Graph. `f(0_L) = 8_R` and `f(6_L) = 1_R`. Edge (8_R, 1_R) exists in Right Graph. (Preserved)\n*   Edge (6_L, 7_L) exists in Left Graph. `f(6_L) = 1_R` and `f(7_L) = 6_R`. Edge (1_R, 6_R) exists in Right Graph. (Preserved)\n\nAll existing edges are preserved, and since all non-edges remain non-edges, this mapping demonstrates isomorphism.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nYes, the two graphs are isomorphic.",
