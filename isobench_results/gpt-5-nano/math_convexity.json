Constants do not affect convexity, and multiplying a convex function by a positive constant preserves convexity.\n- The function |x| is a well-known convex function (it forms a V shape). Its derivative is -2.23 for x<0 and +2.23 for x>0, with a kink at x=0; the slope changes from negative to positive, which is consistent with convexity.\n- The second derivative f''(x) is 0 for x ≠ 0 and undefined at x = 0 (due to the kink).
