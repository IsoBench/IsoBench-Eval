Thus node 10 is isolated: it has neither incoming nor outgoing edges.\n\n- Starting from node 12 (row 12), its neighbors are 0 and 11. From there, you can reach nodes such as 0, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, but not node 10.\n\n- Since there is no edge into node 10, there is no path from node 12 to node 10.
