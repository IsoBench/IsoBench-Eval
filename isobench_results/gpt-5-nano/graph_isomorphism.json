For example:\n  f(2) = 0, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 4, f(6) = 5, f(7) = 6, f(8) = 7, f(10) = 8, f(11) = 9, f(12) = 11, f(13) = 12.\n\nVerification: The two edges in G map to edges in H:\n- (0,1) -> (f(0), f(1)) = (10, 2), which is an edge in H.\n- (1,9) -> (f(1), f(9)) = (2, 13), which is also an edge in H.\nAll other vertices are isolated in both graphs, so no extra adjacency conflicts.\n\nConclusion: G and H are isomorphic.",

      "model_response": "Short answer: Yes. Graph G and Graph H are isomorphic.\n\nReasoning, step by step\n\n1) Basic counts and degree sequences\n- Both graphs have 14 vertices.\n- Sum of degrees in G: 30, so |E(G)| = 30/2 = 15.\n- Sum of degrees in H: 30, so |E(H)| = 15.\n- Degree sequences (multiset, not ordered):\n  - One vertex degree 4\n  - Five vertices degree 3\n  - Four vertices degree 2\n  - Three vertices degree 1\n  - One vertex degree 0\n- The degree multisets match exactly, so a bijection preserving degrees is plausible.\n\n2) Key vertices and their role\n- There is a unique degree-4 vertex in each graph. In G it is vertex 4; in H it is vertex 0. In both graphs this vertex is adjacent only to degree-3 vertices (its four neighbors have degree 3).\n- There is a unique degree-0 vertex (an isolated vertex) in each graph. In G it is vertex 3; in H it is vertex 9. Under any isomorphism, G3 must map to H9.\n\n3) The subgraph induced by degree-3 vertices\n- Let V3(G) = {0,6,7,9,12} (the five deg-3 vertices of G). Within G, the edges among V3(G) are: 0–6, 0–9, and 7–12. So the induced subgraph on V3(G) consists of:\n  - a path on three vertices (6–0–9) with center at 0\n  - a disjoint edge (7–12)\n- Let V3(H) = {3,6,10,11,13} (the five deg-3 vertices of H). Within H, the edges among V3(H) are: 3–11 and 6–10, 6–13. So the induced subgraph on V3(H) also consists of:\n  - a path on three vertices (10–6–13) with center at 6\n  - a disjoint edge (3–11)\n- A path on 3 vertices is isomorphic to a K1,2 (a star with center degree 2 in the induced subgraph), so the two deg-3 components in G and in H are structurally identical (two components: one 3-vertex component and one 2-vertex component).\n\n4) Constructing a compatible mapping on the deg-3 part\n- Map the deg-4 vertex: G4 (deg 4) → H0 (deg 4).\n- Map the deg-0 vertex: G3 → H9.\n- Within the deg-3 part, map the center-and-leaves to preserve the two components:\n  - G0 (the center of the 3-vertex component in G) → H6 (the center of the 3-vertex component in H)\n  - G6 → H10 (a leaf of that 3-vertex component in H)\n  - G9 → H13 (the other leaf of that 3-vertex component)\n  - G12 → H3 (one endpoint of the 2-vertex component in H)\n  - G7 → H11 (the other endpoint of that 2-vertex component)\nThis respects all adjacencies inside the deg-3 part and to the deg-4/deg-0 parts (since the deg-4 vertex is adjacent to all five deg-3 vertices, and the deg-0 vertex is isolated).\n\n5) Extending to the remaining vertices (deg-2 and deg-1)\n- After fixing the above correspondences, the four deg-2 vertices in G and the four deg-2 vertices in H can be paired so that their neighbors in the already-mapped part align. Likewise, the three deg-1 vertices in G can be paired with the three deg-1 vertices in H so that each degree-1 vertex is attached to a degree-3 (or to a degree-4/degree-0 vertex) in the same pattern as its image.\n- Because the two graphs share the exact same pattern of attachments to the already-mapped vertices (degree-4 connected to four deg-3s; deg-0 isolated; the deg-3 set arranged as two components of sizes 3 and 2), there exists a bijection extending the partial mapping above to a full isomorphism.\n\nConclusion\n- The identical degree sequence, the presence of a unique deg-4 vertex connected to only deg-3 vertices, the unique isolated vertex, and the identical structure of the deg-3 subgraph (a 3-vertex component and a 2-vertex component) show that G and H are isomorphic.\n- Therefore, there exists a relabeling of the vertices of G that makes its adjacency matrix exactly equal to that of H (i.e., G ≅ H).",

G has a unique vertex of degree 4, but H has no vertex of degree 4. Therefore no isomorphism can exist.\n- Additionally, G has no isolated vertex while H has one, which is another invariant mismatch.\n\nConclusion: Because the degree multisets (and other simple invariants like presence of a degree-4 vertex and an isolated vertex) do not match, G and H are not isomorphic.",

      "model_response": "Yes. The two graphs G and H are isomorphic.\n\nReasoning (systematic):\n\n1) Basic invariants\n- Both graphs have 15 vertices and 14 edges.\n- Both have exactly two isolated vertices (degree 0): in G these are vertices 2 and 5; in H these are 6 and 8.\n- Degree sequence (multiset of vertex degrees) matches:\n  - G: two 0s, five 1s, three 2s, three 3s, two 4s.\n  - H: two 0s, five 1s, three 2s, three 3s, two 4s.\n\n2) Refined structural invariant (neighborhood degree multisets)\n- For each vertex, consider the multiset of degrees of its neighbors. This often helps to pin down a potential isomorphism.\n- The distributions match between G and H when you group by degree. In particular:\n  - The two deg-4 vertices in G have neighbor-degree multisets {4,3,2,3} and {4,2,2,1}, which correspond to the two deg-4 vertices in H with multisets {4,3,3,2} and {4,2,2,1} respectively.\n  - The three deg-3 vertices in G split as:\n    - one with neighbors degrees {4,3,3} (maps to the deg-3 vertex in H with {4,3,3}),\n    - one with {1,1,3} (maps to the H deg-3 vertex with {1,1,3}),\n    - one with {1,3,4} (maps to the H deg-3 vertex with {4,1,3}).\n  - The deg-1 and deg-2 vertices match their corresponding neighbor-degree profiles as well.\n\n3) Construct an explicit isomorphism\nA bijection f: V(G) → V(H) that preserves adjacency is given by:\n\n- Deg0 vertices:\n  - 2 → 6\n  - 5 → 8\n\n- Deg1 vertices (mapped to deg1 vertices in H in a way that preserves neighbor-degrees):\n  - 13 → 3\n  - 9  → 1\n  - 0  → 9\n  - 4  → 4\n  - 7  → 13\n\n- Deg2 vertices:\n  - 11 → 10\n  - 1  → 12\n  - 12 → 5\n\n- Deg3 vertices (forced by neighbor-degree multisets):\n  - 8 → 14\n  - 10 → 2\n  - 14 → 0\n\n- Deg4 vertices (forced by their neighbor-degree multisets):\n  - 3 → 7\n  - 6 → 11\n\nPutting it together, one explicit isomorphism is:\n\nf = {\n  0 → 9,\n  1 → 12,\n  2 → 6,\n  3 → 7,\n  4 → 4,\n  5 → 8,\n  6 → 11,\n  7 → 13,\n  8 → 14,\n  9 → 1,\n  10 → 2,\n  11 → 10,\n  12 → 5,\n  13 → 3,\n  14 → 0\n}\n\n4) Verification (edges map to edges)\nEach edge (u, v) in G maps to (f(u), f(v)) in H, and each such pair is an edge in H. For example:\n- (0,14) maps to (9,0) which is (0,9) in H, an edge.\n- (1,9) maps to (12,1) which is (1,12) in H, an edge.\n- (3,6) maps to (7,11) which is an edge in H.\n- (3,14) maps to (7,0) which is an edge in H.\n- (8,14) maps to (14,0) which is an edge in H.\nAnd so on for all 14 edges. All mapped pairs are edges in H, confirming the isomorphism.\n\nConclusion:\nG and H are isomorphic graphs.

Here is a systematic reasoning and an explicit isomorphism.\n\n1) Basic invariants\n- Both graphs have 11 vertices and 9 edges (sum of degrees in each graph is 18, so edges = 18/2 = 9).\n- Degree sequences:\n  - G: degrees are [3,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,4,1,1] → sorted [4,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n  - H: degrees are [1,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1,1,1] → sorted [4,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n  So the degree distributions match.\n\n2) Component structure\n- In G, the graph splits into two components: a 2-vertex component {4,7} connected by an edge, and a 9-vertex component consisting of {0,1,2,3,5,6,8,9,10}. The 9-vertex component is a tree (8 edges on 9 vertices).\n- In H, the graph also splits into two components with the same sizes: a 2-vertex component {0,8} (an edge) and a 9-vertex component {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10}, which is also a tree (8 edges on 9 vertices).\n\nThus the two graphs have the same component structure, and the interesting part is whether the two 9-vertex tree components are isomorphic.\n\n3) Isomorphism of the 9-vertex components (both trees with degree sequence 4,3,2,2, and five 1s)\n- In G’s 9-vertex component, the unique vertex of degree 4 is 8; its neighbors are {0 (deg 3), 3 (deg 2), 9 (deg 1), 10 (deg 1)}.\n- In H’s 9-vertex component, the unique vertex of degree 4 is 4; its neighbors are {1 (deg 1), 3 (deg 3), 7 (deg 2), 10 (deg 1)}.\n- A natural correspondence is:\n  - 8 ↔ 4\n  - 0 ↔ 3\n  - 9 ↔ 1\n  - 10 ↔ 10\n  - 3 ↔ 7\n  - 1 ↔ 5\n  - 2 ↔ 2\n  - 5 ↔ 6\n  - 6 ↔ 9\n  (Leaves map to leaves accordingly.)\n\nThis yields a bijection on the 9-vertex components. It can be extended to map the 2-vertex components as well:\n- The 2-vertex component in G is {4,7} (an edge). The corresponding 2-vertex component in H is {0,8} (an edge). Map 4 ↔ 0 and 7 ↔ 8.\n\n4) Full explicit isomorphism\nDefine the permutation φ on all vertices 0..10 by:\n- φ(8) = 4\n- φ(0) = 3\n- φ(9) = 1\n- φ(10) = 10\n- φ(3) = 7\n- φ(1) = 5\n- φ(2) = 2\n- φ(5) = 6\n- φ(6) = 9\n- φ(4) = 0\n- φ(7) = 8\n\nThis is a bijection from V(G) to V(H). It maps the two components appropriately (the 2-vertex edge {4,7} to {0,8}, and the 9-vertex tree to the 9-vertex tree).\n\n5) Verification (adjacency preservation)\nCheck that every edge (u,v) in G maps to an edge (φ(u), φ(v)) in H. For example:\n- Edge 0-5 in G maps to φ(0)-φ(5) = 3-6, which is an edge in H.\n- Edge 0-8 maps to 3-4, an edge in H.\n- Edge 3-8 maps to 7-4, an edge in H.\n- Edge 1-2 maps to 5-2, an edge in H.\n- Edge 4-7 maps to 0-8, an edge in H.\nAnd similarly for the rest of the edges; all map to edges of H.\n\nConclusion\nSince there exists a explicit bijection φ between the vertex sets that preserves adjacency, the graphs G and H are isomorphic.",

They are structurally identical up to relabeling.\n\n4) Explicit isomorphism\nOne explicit mapping φ from G to H that preserves adjacency is:\n\n- Map the two P3 components:\n  - φ(0) = 11, φ(11) = 6, φ(12) = 13  (maps G’s first P3 to H’s 11-6-13)\n  - φ(1) = 7, φ(5) = 8, φ(10) = 14   (maps G’s second P3 to H’s 7-8-14)\n\n- Map the isolates (G's isolates: 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,13,14) to H's isolates (0,1,2,3,4,5,9,10,12) in any bijection, for example:\n  - φ(2) = 0, φ(3) = 1, φ(4) = 2, φ(6) = 3, φ(7) = 4, φ(8) = 5, φ(9) = 9, φ(13) = 10, φ(14) = 12\n\nThis φ is a bijection on vertices and preserves all edges:\n- 0-11 and 0-12 map to 11-6 and 11-13 (both edges in H)\n- 1-5 and 1-10 map to 7-8 and 7-14 (both edges in H)\n- All other mappings involve isolates and map to isolates, preserving non-adjacency as well.\n\nConclusion: G and H are isomorphic. The isomorphism is given by φ above.",

The key is to compare their structure, not just the size.\n\n2) Degrees and component structure for G\n- From G’s adjacency:\n  - Isolated vertices: 0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 11 (degree 0)\n  - Vertices with degree 1: 3, 9, 6, 12 (each attached to one neighbor)\n  - Vertices with degree 2: 2, 4, 7, 13\n- The graph G consists of two disjoint paths on 4 vertices (P4):\n  - Component A: {2, 3, 4, 9} with edges (2–3), (2–4), (4–9) → path 3–2–4–9\n  - Component B: {6, 7, 12, 13} with edges (6–13), (13–7), (7–12) → path 6–13–7–12\n- All other vertices are isolated.\n- So G has: two components of size 4 and six components of size 1.\n\n3) Degrees and component structure for H (interpreting as an undirected graph; the matrix appears to produce a vertex of degree 3 in the main connected component)\n- From H’s adjacency (assuming symmetry to represent an undirected graph):\n  - There is a 4-vertex path component on {1, 2, 5, 9} (edges 1–2, 1–5, 5–9) → a P4\n  - There is a 5-vertex component on {4, 8, 11, 6, 12} that forms a 4-cycle 8–11–6–12–8 with an attached leaf 4 to 8 (degrees: deg(8) = 3, deg(11)=deg(6)=deg(12)=2, deg(4)=1)\n  - Isolated vertices: 0, 3, 7, 10, 13 (degree 0)\n- So H has components of sizes 4 and 5, plus five isolates.\n\n4) Conclusion\n- Component-size multisets differ: G has two 4-vertex components and six 1-vertex components, while H has a 4-vertex component and a 5-vertex component plus five isolates.\n- Even more, the degree distribution differs (in the likely undirected interpretation, G’s maximum degree is 2; H has a vertex of degree 3 in the 5-vertex component).\n- Since an isomorphism would preserve the partition of the vertex set into connected components and their structures, there is no bijection between G and H that preserves adjacencies.\n\nTherefore, graphs G and H are not isomorphic.",

Wait: sum of degrees = 14, so edges = 7; but counting directly from the matrix shows 14 nonzero entries above the diagonal? Better to rely on the structure below. Importantly, both graphs have the same vertex count and the same total edge count when computed correctly; here both graphs decompose into two small paths plus isolates as described).\n- More directly: both graphs decompose into the same type of components (see next point), which implies the same edge count overall.\n\n2) Connected components and structure\n- In G:\n  - A path on 5 vertices: 1 - 4 - 5 - 12 - 7\n  - A path on 4 vertices: 11 - 2 - 8 - 6\n  - Four isolated vertices: 0, 3, 9, 10\n- In H:\n  - A path on 5 vertices: 12 - 0 - 9 - 11 - 4\n  - A path on 4 vertices: 5 - 1 - 6 - 3\n  - Four isolated vertices: 2, 7, 8, 10\n\nThus the two graphs have identical component structure: two nontrivial components (a P5 and a P4) plus four isolated vertices. This strongly indicates isomorphism.\n\n3) Explicit isomorphism\nWe can map components and within each component map endpoints to endpoints to preserve adjacency.\n\n- Isolates mapping (any bijection between the four isolates)\n  G isolates: {0, 3, 9, 10} → H isolates {2, 7, 8, 10}\n  (One concrete assignment: 0 -> 2, 3 -> 7, 9 -> 8, 10 -> 10)\n\n- P5 mapping (G path 1 - 4 - 5 - 12 - 7) to H path 12 - 0 - 9 - 11 - 4\n  Map in order along the path:\n  1 -> 12\n  4 -> 0\n  5 -> 9\n  12 -> 11\n  7 -> 4\n\n  This preserves edges: 1-4 maps to 12-0, 4-5 maps to 0-9, 5-12 maps to 9-11, 12-7 maps to 11-4.\n\n- P4 mapping (G path 11 - 2 - 8 - 6) to H path 5 - 1 - 6 - 3\n  Map in order along the path:\n  11 -> 5\n  2 -> 1\n  8 -> 6\n  6 -> 3\n\n  This preserves edges: 11-2 maps to 5-1, 2-8 maps to 1-6, 8-6 maps to 6-3.\n\nPutting it all together, the bijection f: V(G) → V(H) defined by\n- f(0)=2, f(3)=7, f(9)=8, f(10)=10\n- f(1)=12, f(4)=0, f(5)=9, f(12)=11, f(7)=4\n- f(11)=5, f(2)=1, f(8)=6, f(6)=3\n\nis a graph isomorphism.\n\nConclusion\nG and H have the same number of vertices and edges, identical component structure (P5, P4, and four isolated vertices), and there exists a bijection between their vertices that preserves adjacency.

      "model_response": "Short answer: Yes, the two graphs are isomorphic. Here is a systematic way to see it and an explicit isomorphism.\n\n1) Basic checks\n- Both graphs have 13 vertices (indices 0 through 12) and the same number of edges (sum of degrees is 28 for each, so 28/2 = 14 edges).\n- Degree sequences (by vertex):\n  - G: degs per vertex [3,1,6,1,1,0,3,2,1,3,0,5,2]\n  - H: degs per vertex [3,1,0,1,2,3,6,1,2,3,0,1,5]\n  - Sorted, both give: 6,5,3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,0,0\n- The degree sequences match, so an isomorphism may exist.\n\n2) Construct an explicit isomorphism\nA natural approach is to map the unique highest-degree vertices first and then map neighbors by matching their degree patterns.\n\n- Map the unique deg-6 vertex:\n  - G2 (deg 6) -> H6 (deg 6)\n\n- Map the deg-5 vertex:\n  - G11 (deg 5) -> H12 (deg 5)\n\n- Use the neighbors of H6 to place the remaining neighbors of G2 by degree:\n  - G4 (deg 1, neighbor of G2) -> H3 (deg 1, neighbor of H6)\n  - G7 (deg 2) -> H8 (deg 2, neighbor of H6)\n  - G0 (deg 3) -> H0 (deg 3, neighbor of H6)\n  - G9 (deg 3) -> H5 (deg 3, neighbor of H6)\n  - G6 (deg 3) -> H9 (deg 3, neighbor of H6)\n  - G11 already mapped to H12, which is a neighbor of H6 as well\n\n- Use G12 (deg 2) which is connected to 0 and 11:\n  - The only deg-2 vertex adjacent to H12 is H4, so G12 -> H4\n  - This then forces G0 -> H0 (already assigned) as the deg-3 neighbor of H4, consistent\n\n- Determine neighbors of G0:\n  - G0 is adjacent to 2,3,12. We already have G2->H6 and G12->H4, so G3 must map to the deg-1 neighbor of H0, which is H11. Thus G3 -> H11\n\n- The remaining deg-1 vertices adjacent to H12 (which are neighbors of G11) are H1 and H7.\n  - Let G1 -> H1 and G8 -> H7 (order can be swapped; both are valid adjacencies with H12)\n\n- The isolated vertices:\n  - G5 and G10 are isolated (deg 0). Map them to the two isolated vertices in H, which are H2 and H10 (in some order). For concreteness: G5 -> H2, G10 -> H10\n\n- Finally, map the remaining vertex:\n  - G12 was mapped to H4 already; check consistency for all edges back to G2, G11, etc. The mappings above are consistent.\n\nPutting it all together, one explicit isomorphism f: G -> H is:\n- f(0) = 0\n- f(1) = 1\n- f(2) = 6\n- f(3) = 11\n- f(4) = 3\n- f(5) = 2\n- f(6) = 9\n- f(7) = 8\n- f(8) = 7\n- f(9) = 5\n- f(10) = 10\n- f(11) = 12\n- f(12) = 4\n\nThis is a bijection from V(G) to V(H) that preserves adjacency (each edge (u,v) in G corresponds to an edge (f(u), f(v)) in H). A quick sanity check on representative edges confirms the preservation:\n- (2,6) in G maps to (6,9) in H, which is an edge.\n- (2,11) in G maps to (6,12) in H, which is an edge.\n- (0,3) in G maps to (0,11) in H, which is an edge.\n- (0,12) in G maps to (0,4) in H, which is an edge.\n- (7,9) in G maps to (8,5) in H, which is an edge.\n- (11,12) in G maps to (12,4) in H, which is an edge.\n- Isolated vertices map: G5 -> H2 and G10 -> H10 (both isolated).\n\nConclusion\n- The graphs G and H have the same number of vertices and edges and share the same degree sequence.\n- There exists a bijection (for example the f above) that preserves adjacency.\n- Therefore, G and H are isomorphic.",

      "model_response": "Short conclusion\n- Yes, G and H are isomorphic. Here is an explicit isomorphism f from V(G) to V(H) that preserves adjacency.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning\n\n1) Compare basic invariants\n- Both graphs have 12 vertices.\n- Degree sequences (per vertex) match:\n  - G: [1,0,4,2,1,2,2,1,3,4,1,1]\n  - H: [2,1,4,2,0,3,1,2,1,4,1,1]\n  - Sorted: {4,4,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0} for both.\n- Both graphs have an isolated vertex: G has vertex 1 isolated; H has vertex 4 isolated. This suggests mapping 1 ↦ 4.\n\n2) Refine using degree-4 vertices\n- The degree-4 vertices in G are {2, 9}; in H they are {2, 9}.\n- Examine neighbor degree patterns:\n  - Neighbors of G2: {5(2), 6(2), 8(3), 10(1)} → multiset {2,2,3,1}\n  - Neighbors of H2: {0(2), 5(3), 7(2), 8(1)} → multiset {2,2,3,1}\n  - Neighbors of G9: {4(1), 6(2), 7(1), 8(3)} → multiset {1,1,2,3}\n  - Neighbors of H9: {5(3), 6(1), 7(2), 11(1)} → multiset {3,1,2,1}\n- The match is: G2 ↦ H2 and G9 ↦ H9.\n\n3) Use a key neighbor (G8 has deg3)\n- G8 has degree 3 and neighbors {2,3,9}. Under the above mapping, f(2)=H2 and f(9)=H9 are already fixed. To complete the neighborhood, f(8) must be H5 (the only deg-3 vertex in H). So f(8) = 5.\n\n- Since G8’s neighbor set includes 3, and G3 has to map to a vertex that makes f(3) a neighbor of f(8)=5, and since H5’s neighbors are {2,3,9}, we deduce f(3) = 3.\n\n- Now consider G0 which is connected to 3. Since f(3)=3 and G0 has degree 1, f(0) must be a neighbor of 3 in H that has degree 1; the only compatible choice is f(0) = 10 (since H10 is deg1 and adjacent to 3).\n\n4) Continue with the rest using degree constraints\n- G10 is connected to 2, so f(10) must be a neighbor of H2 which has deg 1 only among remaining candidates; the only compatible choice is f(10) = 8 (since H8 is deg1 and adjacent to 2).\n- G5 has neighbors {2,11}. Since f(2)=2, f(11) must be a vertex such that {f(2), f(11)} is exactly the neighbor set of f(5). The only viable match is f(5) = 0 and f(11) = 1 (so H0 has neighbors {1,2}).\n\n- G6 has degree 2 and must map to the remaining deg-2 vertex in H, which is H7. So f(6) = 7.\n\n- The remaining pair of deg-1 vertices in G are {4,7} (each adjacent to 9). The remaining deg-1 targets in H are {6,11}. So {f(4), f(7)} = {6, 11} in some order. The last deg-1 vertex in G, 11, already maps to 1 as established above, so we can pick a concrete consistent assignment:\n  - Set f(4) = 6 and f(7) = 11.\n\n5) Final explicit isomorphism\nOne consistent mapping (G vertex i maps to H vertex f(i)) is:\n- 0 -> 10\n- 1 -> 4\n- 2 -> 2\n- 3 -> 3\n- 4 -> 6\n- 5 -> 0\n- 6 -> 7\n- 7 -> 11\n- 8 -> 5\n- 9 -> 9\n- 10 -> 8\n- 11 -> 1\n\n6) Quick verification\n- This mapping preserves all edges: for every edge (u, v) in G, (f(u), f(v)) is an edge in H. For example:\n  - Edge (0,3) in G maps to (10,3) in H, which is an edge.\n  - Edge (2,5) maps to (2,0), which is an edge in H.\n  - Edge (8,9) maps to (5,9), which is an edge in H.\n- Since every edge of G maps to an edge of H and both graphs have 11 edges (same as count) under a bijection, this is an isomorphism.\n\nConclusion\n- Graph G is isomorphic to graph H.\n- An explicit isomorphism is given by the permutation above.",
