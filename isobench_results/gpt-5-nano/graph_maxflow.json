Now flow = 5.\n  2) Push 6 along 0→1→3 (0→1 cap 6, 1→3 cap 6). Now flow = 5+6 = 11.\n  3) Push 4 along 0→2→3 (0→2 cap 4, 2→3 cap 5). Now flow = 11+4 = 15.\n- In this final state, the edges out of the source are saturated: 0→1 (6), 0→2 (4), 0→3 (5) are all used up, and the sink receives 5+6+4 = 15 units.\n- Since 15 is also the capacity of the cut consisting of {0} on the source side (sum of capacities leaving 0), this is the minimum cut and thus the maximum flow.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow from node 0 to node 3 is 15.",
